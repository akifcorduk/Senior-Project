Gotta go do something else.... #missingallthefun 'My view is the legal services direction is entirely routine in nature as it does not change the law in any way' - Attorney-General Brandis A-G proffers his definition of consultation. He and the S-G seem to have differing definitions of what constitutes being 'consulted'. A-G: 'The notes of my staff confirm that I raised the issue of the legal services direction' in meeting with S-G in Nov last year. A-G: 'I consulted the Solicitor-Gen about the process of referring a question of law to him, which is the very purpose of the direction.' A-G says his statement about consultation was accurate &amp; his department had advised him so. It didn't specify nature of consultation. A-G also said he wrote to S-G on Aug 16 to engage with him on the issue of the legal direction but that S-G Gleeson didn't reply. A-G Brandis stands by every word of his submission &amp; expresses surprise that he wasnt initially invited to give evidence. Had to ask to appr A-G says he didnt respond to S-G's letter of complaint during election campaign because govt was in caretaker mode. Delegated to Dept sec. A-G refutes Solicitor-Gen's suggestion that the direction requiring pre-approval to give advice has constrained or delayed that advice. A-G begins evidence. Says S-Gen didnt tell him he spoke to Oppn. 'I consider that he ought to have done so &amp; I was shocked that he did not'. S-G re responding to questions from opposition during caretaker period: 'Nobody is more acutely conscious of confidentiality than I am' S-G says he makes 'no apology' for answering qn from shadow AG (or any member of the 44th Parlt) during caretaker period re AG direction.

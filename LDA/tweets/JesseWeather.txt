Moving: NNE at 14 mph
Min pressure: 983 mb

Storms are firing right around the center still.  #Hermine still trying to get stronger. https://t.co/WHkqnW9KeG @Sandman_HQ Forecast to be a tropical storm with 40-60 mph winds at that point most likely. @Sandman_HQ It has the potential to gain a little more strength.  I think it will stay Cat 1, but don't be shocked at 80-85 mph winds. The center of #Hermine is located only about 70 miles south of Apalachicola, FL currently. https://t.co/aazOSY8L2g Hard to believe, but the last hurricane to make landfall in Florida was Wilma in '05. 11 yrs ago.

Winds are at 40mph, moving north at 2 mph. https://t.co/bUCOvO72un @EricBurrisWESH I'm waiting for the intermediate update like I used to wait for Santa Claus when I was younger.  🎅🏻 I believe #TD9 will be upgraded to Tropical Storm #Hermine either at the NHC 1pm intermediate update, or the 4pm full update.  Stay tuned... 10am NHC cone for #TD9.  Still a depression.  Nearly stationary. Cone remains relatively unchanged. https://t.co/g6JLN5WSAP 10pm NHC cone shows a track shifted slightly left.  More importantly, #TD9 is now moving NNW. Starting to make turn. https://t.co/N4eZdmOCcK Important thing to note in the latest NHC update is that #TD9 has started moving NW now.  Good news for SE LA! Should go N then NE tomorrow. Here's the 4pm NHC cone for #TD9.  Tropical storm and hurricane watches have been posted in the pink/yellow colors. https://t.co/dCnZxkeYG1 #TheMoreYouKnow https://t.co/HNan1fpVUS Tropical Storm watches likely to be issued for portions of the Florida coast later today. 10am NHC cone for #TD9 remains pretty much unchanged.

Very broad circulation. What do you think? I'll be doing a live update later tonight after the 10pm NHC update is released. https://t.co/M5FbOtpUal With the way TD8 and TD9's mid-level cloud tops are getting sheared, it appears they both may be celebrating #GoToplessDay. The biggest concern from #TD9 at this point will be the heavy rain threat mainly in Florida. https://t.co/En104ct0bL How strong will TD9 get? Models all over the place.

NHC: "The confidence in the intensity forecast is lower than usual for this system." An OFFICIAL forecast track!  WNW motion, then a more north and east hook as weak trop storm toward Florida Big Bend. https://t.co/YPjMd2Bzet So long to saying the name Invest 99.  Now it's got a new name: Depression #9.  I'm going to have nightmares involving the number 9! Apparently, the Recon found enough of a closed low.  99L is now a depression.  NHC will initiate advisories on Tropical Depression 9 at 4pm. Radar out of Key West shows 99L's low-level center may be trying to tighten up a bit. Better chance out in the Gulf. https://t.co/SRf9Bxgori RT @EricBurrisWESH: Recon flight wheels up from Tampa and heading into #Invest99.

Interested to see what the RECON plane finds later today. https://t.co/dNHy79gRxx Meanwhile, we have some strong storms moving in from the southeast this morning.  60% rain chance for today. https://t.co/WTLZ2Wo9O0 Area between North Carolina &amp; Bermuda has been upgraded to Tropical Depression 8. NHC will issue advisories at 10am. https://t.co/jRzRuGpNZk @hurricanetrack I'll raise you to $20. I'm thinking 91L near North Carolina may become #Hermine before 99L. If that happens, 99L may eventually become Ian. https://t.co/ffC16gS2fj @GregPostel And not much will change today.  Upper-low to the north is ripping it to shreds currently. Need to wait until tomorrow at least. NHC keeps 99L odds the same at 7am.  40% over 2 days, 60% over 5 days.  Hurricane Hunters scheduled to fly later. https://t.co/Q8FvFotEAF Showers associated with 99L starting to be picked up by Key West radar.  Notice a very broad circulation. https://t.co/HqgtDfmZGH @alycecraddock The question is, how soon does that trough dip, and how strong will it be?  Those are unknowns. @alycecraddock A dipping trough along the East Coast should create weakness in high pressure and allow for a weakness for the storm to hook. Upper-level low north of 99L is just ripping it to shreds this morning.  Still dealing with plenty of wind shear. https://t.co/MCHqpXKEZH 99L still struggling on satellite, but NHC actually bumps up odds to 40% over 2 days, and 60% over 5 days. https://t.co/9pCPS9TuB4 For what it's worth, I'm leaning towards 99L developing into a weak tropical storm by Mon/Tues, and hooking east toward big bend of Florida. NHC bumps up 99L odds to 40% over 2 days, 50% over 5 days. Hurricane Hunters scheduled to fly into system on Sunday. https://t.co/q26wiUIu5I 99L putting up a good fight today.

Low-level spin is west of that. https://t.co/UPHLiN3LsD NHC now has 99L odds at 30% for next 2 days, 40% over 5 days.

Still a weak, disorganized system, drifting west. https://t.co/qnCMWOfOVA NHC lowers 99L odds for development to 20% next 2 days, 40% next 5 days.  Weaker system, thus track shifted west. https://t.co/qTGswoP5k8 *Just an FYI* https://t.co/XsVg7NeZ6t NHC lowers development odds for 99L to 20% over 2 days, and 50% over 5 days.  Both the GFS and Euro keep it weak. https://t.co/OKLqek7d72 If there's this much hype from a raggedy Invest, can you imagine the chaos that will ensue if 99L is upgraded to a depression or a storm? With all of that said, 99L is still not a very healthy system. It won't be until there is a consistent convection wrapping around LL center. Basically, this broad tropical wave is exploring new ways to stay alive. And, at least for now, it appears to still have a pulse. #Invest99L Regarding 99L, it appears original LL center from yesterday moved W and died. New LL center more north is where convection is located today. @Clint_Money 🙄 NHC now has 99L odds at 30% over 2 days, 60% over 5 days.  Other area in Gulf only has 10% odds as it drifts west. https://t.co/nZbI1B5PN7 Let's start a petition to have the name "Invest 99L" retired.  This has been a legendary invest, especially considering lack of development. Said yesterday once 99L moved away from Hispaniola, inflow on E side would be freed up. Likely now why we're seeing more flare up on E side. Starting to see a little flare-up of convection near 99L apparent center of circulation.  Need to see if it lasts. https://t.co/ReEBMCKR0M NHC lowers 99L's 2 day chances to 20%, and keeps it at 60% over next 5 days. Other area in Gulf still at 10%. https://t.co/Xp5SgoqtPM @JesseWeather Yea, for now.  I think they want to wait out the next 24-48 hours before making any more drastic changes to percentages. NHC keeps 99L at 30% over 2 days, 60% over 5 days. New area in Gulf has been highlighted at 10%, not likely to form. https://t.co/x0yYYjHtYr Not seeing any signs of organization from 99L tonight. No blowup convection like last night. NHC may lower % at 1am. https://t.co/BHiYIipILz *Tonight's Tropical Update Live!* https://t.co/dluAFHhFQW I got 99L problems, but a ridge ain't one. Tonight, I'm gonna party like it's 19-99L. NHC lowers development chances for 99L to 30% over next 2 days, and 60% over the next 5 days. https://t.co/HOkR9NsILH You wanna scare the crap out of people this Halloween?  

Dress up as 99L.  

#Nightmares It will be interesting to see if the National Hurricane Center lowers their percentage for development again for 99L at the 7pm update. I know people are tired of seeing different spaghetti models.  So, here's a picture of a nice spaghetti dish. https://t.co/1hsWTtekol RT @SteveWAFB: Great #lightning capture from Josh Rivera in Plaquemine earlier today. #LAwx https://t.co/tbatkd39Nm Think of 99L as drunk now, then hungover tomorrow. By Saturday, starting to recover and can be taken serious. Unless it dies before then. 😳 @Clint_Money On life support.  The next 24-48 hours are critical.  Sorry to sound like a doctor. Hey, 99L, you're leaving your convection behind in Hispaniola.  Center looking all naked and exposed. #LifeSupport https://t.co/eFjxQboPSs NHC regarding 99L: "Shower and thunderstorm activity has become significantly less organized during the past 24 hours." NHC lowers development chances for 99L.  40% over next 2 days, and 70% over the next 5 days.  Still high likelihood. https://t.co/d5VN5gArLk 99L "center" is in red. Hispaniola is circled in yellow. LL inflow is being blocked by mountains. Dry slot in green. https://t.co/VDOrEzJYX4 Even with 99L's raggedy look.  NHC still says 50% chance for depression or storm in next 2 days, 80% over 5 days. https://t.co/lhjpgOtqBH 99L has some convection, but not near the apparent center. Hispaniola mountains will also disrupt development today. https://t.co/sS6AR8sTPN

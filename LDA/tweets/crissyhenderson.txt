It's because God uses the talent pool available. He can use you - Philip Yancey A job is something you choose. A calling is something for which you are chosen. Every major religion gives you a moral code. Only the Christian faith gives you righteousness as a sequence to redemption, not prior to it. If there is no definition of what it means to be human, then life becomes disposable. That is what is happening in society today.

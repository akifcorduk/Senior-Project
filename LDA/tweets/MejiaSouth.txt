Smedley Butler. He's idolized in Marine Corps history. They teach us everything about him, except about his book. The majority of U.S. citizens have never seen war, yet they'll seemingly cont to have an unwavering support for &amp; love to engage in warfare. The U.S. mil is not a force 4 humanitarian purposes, but its proficient at taking life, contaminating lands &amp; plundering natural resources. Why continue to spend money that explores and identifies innovative ways to continue the destruction of life? Why continue funding an industry whose self-interest lies in perpetuating war? The greatest threats to humanity are the military-industrial complex composed of military contractors and their lobbyists. In case you still reside in a bubble, corporate profiteering is the primary, and often only motivation to engage in war. In other words, the Pentagon will ante up billions to politically-connected corporations of the armaments industry.

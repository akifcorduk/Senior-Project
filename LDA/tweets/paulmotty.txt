There are numerous unanswered questions &amp; intelligence. Its their job to investigate it. @OliverWest100 Please. They spent over a year investigating e-mail servers. Despite her predecessor doing the same &amp; probably half of DC! @OliverWest100 Ah not proven, but OK to play politics and smear? So why, when Trump lives by this sword, should he not die by it? @OliverWest100 Even Kenneth Starr dismissed the claims of the others. Cable news ran it ad nauseum in 90s, now Trumpians claim cover-up üòÇüòÇ @OliverWest100 Comey stated there is an ongoing investigation, based on intelligence. FISA warrant known, proof may or may not materialise. @OliverWest100 A smear like parading Clinton 'rape' victims whose stories were debunked even by GOPs more than a decade earlier? @OliverWest100 No, because it hasn't come from nowhere. Allegations pre-date election &amp; the Steele dossier has far from been debunked. @OliverWest100 If so, it will be exposed. Why so scared of investigation? @OliverWest100 Oh I think if any Clinton/Obama/Cruz/Rubio/Bush operative had done that, Trump would have been tweeting 'liar!' ad nauseum. @OliverWest100 Think you'll find plenty of Dems claiming so - from treason down! If politically motivated investigations are OK then... @OliverWest100 So why object to investigation? Or lie about the relationship - like Flynn, Sessions? @OliverWest100 Can't see why illegality is key. Were Clinton e-mails illegal? If there's no conspiracy, why object to investigation? @OliverWest100 Flynn never registered. Manafort was sacked after revelations. More justification for investigation. @OliverWest100 I know, plus predictions of Clinton/Podesta demise. Hence why US agencies are bound to investigate #Trumprussia collusion. @rafi17 They don't want them. Trident renewal is a great divide issue between England/Scotland. @OliverWest100 Mike Flynn was a foreign agent, for Turkey. Manafort worked for Yanukovich. Stone admits colluding with Guccifer. @rafi17 A 5 year negotiation to rival the Brexit marathon about to begin;) Would Putin want a candidate who supports Brexit/wants more Brexits? Comey: Yes. #Trumprussia Budget u-turn was classic example of a micro issue being hyped by lazy Westminster Village media. https://t.co/D8TZwk3bhz If #Trumprussia is merely about leaks, rather than substance of charge, Wikileaks allies must surely be called out. https://t.co/8IX2NK0Q6J Having confirmed FBI investigating #Trumprussia links &amp; dismissed Trump wiretap tweets, where are Dems/GOP on Comey nowadays? Friend or foe? GOP seem intent on switching #Trumprussia focus to whistleblowers who leaked info to Wapo rather than substance of investigation. Schiff lists long #Trumprussia timeline: Manafort/altered GOP Ukraine policy, Guccifer, Flynn lies, Steele dossier/Rosneft. Will it stick? #Trumprussia intel committee hearings live on CNN now.

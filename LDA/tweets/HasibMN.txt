Try anything
Be who u want

U will never find satisfaction except w Him "By the morning brightness
And the night when it grows still
Your Lord has never forsaken you or is angry with you..." 

Quran 93:1-3 Your soul wavers
Gets pulled
Attaches
Loses focus
Runs after pleasure... attention... praise

None of it will fulfill you.

Only God does. We run from reality

"Inevitable Reality
What is inevitable reality?
And what will make u understand what inevitable reality is?"

Quran 69 "Be conscious of God &amp; He will teach you"

2:282

Correct yourself
Rectify your soul
Perfect your character

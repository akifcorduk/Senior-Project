Guys, I'm a libertarian, and I love the kind of reporting public radio does. So I donate directly to them. That's what charity is.

Stop demanding he take more and more of your income. Free Enterprise! It's the only system in the world that allows us to engage in mutually beneficial transactions, amass wealth, and donate. Anyone want to venture a guess at what system allows us to amass such wealth and be charitable with that wealth? Anyone?

I listen to public radio, partially funded by tax $. You know what I did last week? I donated to local NPR station. 100% went to @wamu885. We MUST #resist the notion that sending $ to DC to dole out to community orgs is charity. It isn't. It's depriving charities of funds. Every dollar you send to DC, bureaucrats keep a % and return less to community orgs. 

Every dollar you donate directly, 100% goes to orgs. If Mulvaney/@realDonaldTrump's budget cut $ to an org you like, organize a fundraiser for that org. 100% of your $ would go to it, not DC.

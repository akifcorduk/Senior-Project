Thank you for sharing this. #Obamacare #ACA #healthcare #publichealth #humanrights‚Ä¶ https://t.co/aK6zjp6nD5 @camtr0n1 can you continue the conversation on the phone sometime this week? @camtr0n1 So no phone call later, I take it? It's too easy to hide behind yr phone &amp; twitter acct. We need real conversations. I'm willing. @camtr0n1 denying women safe reproductive health is another cruel selfish policy @camtr0n1 denying healthcare IS selfish! Ppl going w/o meds, in pain, unable to work, insurmountable debt, even dying. @camtr0n1 it's not just me it benefits. There are so many lives who have improved because of it. I've heard from them personally. @camtr0n1 the idea that I and others want other ppl to "pay for my shit" is insulting and wrong. Really disrespectful. And arrogant. @camtr0n1 I'd really like to talk on the phone. Not right now. I also have to work. If you can't be brutally honest other than twitter... @camtr0n1 Have you been personally regularly involved in the healthcare system for 19 years? With an expensive disease? @camtr0n1 I pay plenty for it while working. You're being really insulting. You know what, give me a call so we don't do this over twitter @camtr0n1 how can you get quality affordable healthcare without insurance? How can I pay for my $6,000 a month RA drug without insurance? @camtr0n1 the system needs improving but big ins companies were raking in way more money b4 they had to cover everybody. What's your source? @camtr0n1 Do you think it's loving and selfless to deny care, deny a good quality of life to people because they can't get healthcare? @camtr0n1 It's not utopia. Wanting poor, marginalized ppl to have care and help isn't selfish. @camtr0n1 Insurance companies r losing money due to the ACA. Again, do some real research. B4 they were denying ppl right and left for care @camtr0n1 um no they don't! My mom used to work for one and they were livid about the ACA. They were pushing for ppl to vote against Obama @camtr0n1 it should be a basic human right. How anybody can't believe that is selfish and cruel. Ppl shouldn't have to go w/o care. @camtr0n1 I'm lower middle class with a pre-existing condition since age 18. Obamacare saved me as did Medicaid recently. @camtr0n1 ...b4 Obamacare was badly broken! Ppl couldn't afford their healthcare then thanks to greedy insurance companies &amp; priv business @camtr0n1 ...believe that healthcare is a right for all ppl. The selfish ones are those who don't agree with that. also, the system b4... @camtr0n1 it's not guilting others to pay! Look at how other countries w national healthcare work. They pay higher taxes because they... @camtr0n1 you're wrong abt #Obamacare being selfish. It's helped millions of ppl, myself included. Same w #medicaid. Do some research please @camtr0n1 you're right, they don't have a monopoly. But their policies have caused the worst suffering over decades for the everyday person @camtr0n1 that's making a (wrong) generalization. I'm not miserable, but I get angry when innocent ppl suffer frm selfish (GOP) policies @camtr0n1 gross. #MarchForHealth 4/1!

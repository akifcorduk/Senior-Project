Just not my cup of tea anymore.  GN. LOL Twitter is too abnormal and gives me claustrophobia, so much stress that I end up making too many mistakes. Good night. Now I'm on here complaining and telling too much.  Lord it becomes infectious. God forbid I'll starting playing the victim card. I just don't know anymore.  I hate complaining, and it gets on my nerves when some people constantly seek something to complain about. I'm just greeting, not on there to help you solve your personal problems that you created. I have one on there whom I can't say hello to without her bringing up how miserable she is in her marriage. I just keep Facebook open because one of my Goodreads friends prefer to communicate on it.  Otherwise it would be closed. My interest in Twitter has just about run its course.  #boredom I doubt if that will curb this eternal problem on here.  I also hope Twitter is not listing me on the "Who to follow" list. I just added this to my profile: 'Before you follow ask yourself if you're interested in my Tweets. If not, please don't follow.' I don't know how to curb the superficial followers on here. I wish there was a way. smh Orwellian Colleges Socially Engineering Students with Fake Pronouns https://t.co/NY0ho7N5kx #institutingmentalillnessstupidity On page 34 of 159 of Propaganda, by Edward L.

The internet is not a just a toy or spy machine. The internet is an education tool. It's not just for posturing/making money.  It has really enlightened me as a teacher &amp; a person. People have more access to books than ever before in history.  The internet is more than social media.  It's also millions of free books. I've read 10 books so far this year for the Goodreads Challenge.  A couple are plays. I learned &amp; was entertained. https://t.co/05adPKGNNS I feel I have a responsibility to encourage reading and education.  That's part of  what I studied in college (university). I started out as an 6th English teacher, which here in America means reading, writing, and grammar.  I've loved books since I was a child. Just 15-30 minutes a day of reading something of importance is good, better than never reading.  Stretching the brain. Critical thinking. I usually read 5 books at a time of different genres and from American and international authors. I read almost everyday.  Sometimes for about 30 minutes; sometimes for several hours in the evening. Read something of value, literary and current events.  Maybe some junk occasionally. Try to read several times a week or 30 minutes a day. I linked my Goodreads page to Twitter because I hoped that maybe one or two non-readers who are my followers will be encouraged to read.

Anyway.  Too much time on my hands today.  Very occasionally I like to share my thoughts on here, but not like I used to. Sometimes I think God I wish I could repair these folks, but that's useless thinking and arrogant.  They have to try to repair themselves. It's an exasperating, fascinating, and highly sad process.  I often wonder, what happened to a person. Usually the damage is in childhood. In my spare time I've started to try to peel back the layers and understand what makes some folks tick. I believe some on Goodreads inflate the number of books read for the Challenge to get applause.  I find this fascinating, strange, &amp; sad. Even inflating the number of books they read a year... I have my suspicions... Some people will use anything for get attention to try to bandage emptiness, insecurity, fear, loneliness. Today some of my group, the women who seem to have it far worse than the men, use their children. husbands, pets, for applause. This need to build my own little empire of attention. Yes, but we were, but we didn't have social media. I was thinking back the other day.  Was my generation like this, the constant itching for attention &amp; affirmation? Some people are very strange.  I just sit back and observe when I decide to waste time.  However, the observation is a learning experience.

And they're (the elite folk)  probably saying they're useless, mind gone. Time to depopulate.  Sometime to think about. But lose your mind... (I see plenty here sometimes when I'm on here.) They also don't like smart and wise folk either.  Why do they like to destroy ancient populations &amp; regions?  Ponder that one. They want you to lose your mind and humanity so they will have every excuse to take you out in the end (depopulation). I'm getting off because being on here too much means you're on the way to losing your essence as a human. There's a war on humanity and on your humanity. So I'm saying, if u are losing your mind and following every kind of crazy ideology to fit in, you need to stop &amp; think before its too late. They're finished, useless.  Their minds are gone.  So lets slowly depopulate by war, etc.  If they don't get the message we will accelerate. I think they're already saying about a lot of humanity (who have lost their humanity) ah, we need to rid the world of them. Oh, and one more point.  The more insane people become, the more reason these billionaires will have to say it's time to depopulate. No classes for me today.  I resume teaching tomorrow.  I'm gone. Good day. So I'm asking the media and their followers, why?  I will shut up now.  You can answer or not.  I probably won't be here for an answer all look deformed keep saying there's too many people here, like they are the judges &amp; executioners &amp; God's earth is their country club. to have mine and have some respect.

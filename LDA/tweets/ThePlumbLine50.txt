A person of God will tell each of you - turn from your wicked ways and reform your actions; do not follow other gods to serve them. Do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God; many false prophets have gone out into the world. False preachers/teachers will secretly introduce destructive heresies in the Church, even denying the sovereign Lord who bought them. There will always be false prophets &amp; preachers among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you. False messiahs &amp; false prophets will appear &amp; perform great signs &amp; wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect who have been called. Many false prophets, preachers &amp; teachers will appear and deceive many people. (Make sure they are Bible based in God's unchanging Word) ‚ÄúWatch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep‚Äôs clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves." The visions of false prophets/preachers will not expose your sin to ward off your captivity. Their prophecies are false and misleading. ‚ÄúDo not listen to false prophets; they fill you with false hopes. They speak visions from their own minds, not from the mouth of the Lord."

Matt. 13:37,38 Jesus spoke in parables &amp; fulfilled what was said through prophet: "I will open my mouth in parables &amp; utter hidden things since creation" When the harvest time comes for the Church, at Last Day, weeds will be burned (judgment) &amp; Church taken to new home. Matt. 13:29,30 Christians are the wheat, but weeds are sown among them by the enemy, Satan. So both have to grow together until harvest - Church taken up. Blessed are those who see &amp; understand the kingdom of God is by faith in Jesus. Because they see &amp; hear the truth.

Unless they want to lose a major ally to Russia and risk an emerging Russia  @nas_malek My point is that foreign policy goal is the same, but just approached in a different manner no matter who is president of the US @nas_malek What you're talking about wasn't effected because of the civil war in Syria, but because the sanctions put on Russia by the west @nas_malek YPG sells to the highest bidder. FSA isn't working with Russia unless it's a small proxy group. @nas_malek So what's your point? That they will leave the Middle East now? @nas_malek Ok and where did I say they weren't fighting each other? @nas_malek Exactly @nas_malek So what? You must expect western corporations to suddenly move all their oil fields to the U.S. @nas_malek PKK/YPG and FSA  @nas_malek Nonsense, I live close to Texas, and many of my friends lost their jobs working in the oil sector because they can't compete. @nas_malek Thats why I said they didnt want Bashar gone anyway,but when an opportunity arises to have more power and resources they take it @nas_malek He destroyed Syria. Now they have puppets on the ground with huge areas of Syria. They can do as they please now. @nas_malek Nothing compared to the Middle East. They store most of their oil and it's not as profitable. @nas_malek It doesn't matter what technique he used. He still achieved the same goal as bush, just in a different way @nas_malek That's nothing. U.S. Doesn't want Bashar gone anyway. They just wanted to weaken him and steal some oil. @nas_malek Busch was more hands on and Obama just used the UN and GCC to do the same @nas_malek They privatized Iraq's oil to western companies.Iraq is a dump now,what else would they need to control?They still control Syria @nas_malek The only thing they lost is money spent on the war. They still control the Middle East and Europe. @nas_malek They don't have a say. They just make people think they do. Vote democratic or republican, foreign policies will be the same @nas_malek Bush didn't lose any power @nas_malek They weren't duped. They just don't have a say. @nas_malek Nah I don't think it can get any better than the U.S.

But Southern leaders are still tied down with Abdurabuh Mansour and KSA@nas_malek @saharyafa Houthis aren't doing much either.They attack Saudi camps then burn whatever they can't take back with them.Then flee.Then repeat @nas_malek Will the Houthis respond with an increase of fighters towards the border of KSA?

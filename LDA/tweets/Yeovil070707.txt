I am British, have a British passport . But dual Turkish citizenship @thatcherhome It has because I married a woman outside of the EU.I need 70,000 pound in the bank or a 25k job or cant live in my own country @thatcherhome I only have a British Passport . If I used a Turkish one I would need a visa to go to my own country :) @thatcherhome I am sure they will, just after the coup many procedures have changed. I have dual citizenship. I have flown before from Antalya to Gatwick via Istanbul. I have dual turk/Brit citizenship. Is it still ok to use my British passport ? @Gaz1849 @ChukaUmunna @stellacreasy @wesstreeting @LilianGreenwood of course.

From 2009-2015 Obama's administration removed 2.5 million illegals. @Independent illegal immigrants!  Something Obama did also... So what's the story? @PoliticalPics hate Corbyn but this is just bullshit of the highest order @labourlewis Nor does having genuine concerns over Mass immigration but doesn't stop the Left calling people racist if they are so concerned @AZLizzie @PeterStefanovi2 I am not Corbyn's biggest fan and never will be but that is absolutely disgraceful! @angelaeagle @Independent May come as a massive shock to you but most people don't like others breaking  the law and coming illegally! @angelaeagle @Independent so do we take it Angela that you are perfectly OK with people entering the UK illegally and staying here? @jeremycorbyn @MarrShow to be honest  Jezza,  I wouldn't trust you to rebuild a flattened sand castle on Bournemouth beach! @jeremycorbyn Hold on!

So if leave lost we could have said 'we didn't vote to stay in single market' @rickygervais used to like you Rick because you stayed away from the politics and kept us sane.  Oh well take care , bye @HackneyAbbott all this and you can't even be be bothered to write a tweet remembering people who lost their lives!

Battling. A right slog. But while Eddie Jones will be after a better display, England fans won't care. Still top dogs in 6Nations. He hasn't had what you'd call, a quiet half. Mitrovic reacts quickest to a loose ball and fires home. #NUFC, rather undeservedly, 1-0 up. Mitrovic - already on yellow - decides to rake his boot down the Wolves keeper's Achilles. Should be a straight red. Somehow escapes. Crazy. As much as a boost that 4-0 win last week was to Sunderland, that home tousing by S'oton is equally as damning. If there was doubt about the first one, no doubt about the second. Gabbiadini turns &amp; fires home a second for S'oton. #safc in deep trouble.

As far as I'm aware there is nothing in the judgment [8]  I have not given up on this fight and will continue my efforts to clear my name. [7] Once again i'd like to thank anyone who has supported me up until this point and to those that will continue to do so.

Steven [6] I know this result is just as disappointing for the supporters of Irish Athletics as it is for me. [5] I would like to thank everyone whom has supported me in the last year. Unfortunately the result is not the one we were looking for. [4] I will be returning to the sport I love in September with my head held high safe in the knowledge that I have never doped. [3] Miscarriages of justice come in many forms, unfortunately this time it has involved me. [2] Unfortunately the panel has found me guilty of doping. Something I have always been strongly against and will continue to stand against. [1] Today is a sad day.

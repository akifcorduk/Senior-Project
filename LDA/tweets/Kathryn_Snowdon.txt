Both essential for democracy @LefebveM poll results matter, animal abuse matters &amp; democracy matters. We're going round in circles here. Happy New Year. Here are 7 ways you can keep fighting for justice in 2017 https://t.co/4vFI2KLzTQ @LefebveM once again - MPs have already voted to ban fox hunting, but you don't want elected representatives to vote on article 50? @LefebveM and with fox hunting you're also missing the massive ethical issue of animal abuse. @LefebveM the majority is also hugely different. 48/52 vs 84/16. @LefebveM also, with the Brexit Supreme Court case it's not about MPs voting against article 50 it's about allowing Parliament to have a say @LefebveM But if you want to compare the two - MPs have already voted to ban fox hunting (in 2004, as I said) &amp; they should vote on art. 50 @LefebveM they're completely different issues and it seems strange to draw parallels. Why not pick a fight with every other law &amp; poll? @LefebveM Of course MPs should vote on Article 50, that's parliamentary sovereignty - intrinsic to British democracy. @LefebveM You're the first one I've seen draw parallels between this poll &amp; EU ref. Plus MPs have already voted on fox hunting -the 2004 Act @LefebveM no law is going to get 100% support. There'll always be some who advocate theft, fraud &amp; even rape &amp; murder. 84% = signif majority @LefebveM and let's not forget the animals who are torn to shreds by hounds. Including the fox cubs who are bred &amp; killed to train hounds. @LefebveM they are listened to. And fox hunting in its traditional format is illegal. So those who participate are breaking the law. @LefebveM of course they should. It's the law.

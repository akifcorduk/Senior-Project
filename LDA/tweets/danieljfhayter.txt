As far as the #customer is concerned, the interface IS the product 19. Delight does not happen to groups of users it happens to individuals #customers #sales 18. It is important to sell the problem you solve, not the product you‚Äôve built 17. The successful salesperson cares FIRST for the #customer, second for the product 16. Don‚Äôt deliver a product to your #customer. Deliver an experience 15. Your relationship with the #customer NOT the customer‚Äôs relationship with your product is the conduit through which real value flows 14. What the #customer buys and considers value is never a product. It is always utility - what a product or a service does for the customer 13. Don‚Äôt find #customers for your products. Find products for your #customers 12. Quality in a service or product is NOT what you put into it. It is what the #customer gets out of it 11. It doesn‚Äôt make sense to hire smart people and tell them what to do; we hire smart people so they can tell us what to do ~ Steve Jobs 10. Customers do NOT care about your solution. They care about their problems 9. The reason why #customers want you to change things is because they are clueless. You need to guide them 8. Customers don‚Äôt want us to do what they ask, they want us to go FURTHER! 7. If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses ~ Henry Ford 6. Your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning ~ Bill Gates 5. A designer who is explicitly asking what their users want is probably doing it wrong 4. Don‚Äôt ask #customers what they want but ask what problems they need to solve 3. Anybody will say your idea or new product is great if you annoy them for long enough 2. Customers do NOT know what they want. A lot of times people don‚Äôt know what they want until you show it to them ~ Steve Jobs 1.

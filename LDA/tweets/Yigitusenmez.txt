The facts are available for those who search. @al7outhius in 2011 the UN said Yemen has a food insecurity disaster - check - Yemen Food Insecurity Information System yearly reports!!! @al7outhius 6) Because then you can tackle the real causes - even without war - you still would have 11 million ppl facing food insecurity. @al7outhius 5) The sooner you stop blaming others for every crisis and realise for 15 years Yemen was heading to a crisis, the better - why? @al7outhius 4) So as you can see the CAUSE OF THE CRISIS was apparenr WAYBEFORE the WAR. The was has placed a stress, but isnt thr cause @al7outhius 3) The past 10 years food insecurity shows a trend of increase - plus the underfunding of WFP and halving rations @al7outhius 2) Food insecurity 2014 was 9.6million, food insecurity in 2015 before the war was 10.6million - 11% increase even prior to war @al7outhius 1) top right figure is inclusive of 2014 hence distorts the facts. @al7outhius whos AQAP? @al7outhius dead conscious would be when everyone stayed silent as Houthis attacked Dammaj. Say much then? @al7outhius no one denied war exacerbated the situation - we are looking at root causes, as factually it is incorrect to say the war CAUSED @al7outhius stating that a crisis existed before the war - is factual - stating the war caused it, isnt. #NGO failures in #yemencrisis #yemen #yemenisstarving https://t.co/TIelsFLIEs #Pakistan has the 3rd worst child stunting rate in the world due to malnutrition - Nearly half of children are suffering and ppl are silent. @al7outhius based on 2001 UN report, 2006 UN report hmmm lol RT @ANF_TURKCE_: Fransa’da organik tarım yapan çiftlik sayısı 32 bini aştı

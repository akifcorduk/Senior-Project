I beg to differ.

Sincerely,

Probably similar would be my guess. @GSemiotics Plain Dealer is owned by Conde Nast, local free paper is a rag...Crain's Cleveland is not owned by people here. @GSemiotics yeah, it does seem like they've been eroded. Here In Cleveland there's effectively no major independent media organization. I miss Gwen Ifill. RT @JudyWoodruff: FBI Dir Comey says DOJ &amp; FBI have no information that supports Pres Trump charge that Pres Obama wiretapped him @Sigdrifr @Chris_arnade damn it, I thought this was going to be productive. I'm going to get back to work. @Sigdrifr @Chris_arnade huh? @Sigdrifr @Chris_arnade had a port, major freight station, etc. The number of people needed dwindled... They're still in operation in fact. @Sigdrifr @Chris_arnade replaced those that were now less convenient and older. Additional death punchds came from automation (my hometown @Sigdrifr @Chris_arnade Capital that had been poured along infrastructure was effectively wasted and newer and more convenient businesses @Sigdrifr @Chris_arnade US Rt 20 and 6 were superceded by Interstates 80 and 90 and effectively set up ghost towns. @Sigdrifr @Chris_arnade could be one of the elements. Highway systems really screwed a lot of these small places. In my area alone, @adamjohnsonNYC @jchexmix I think that was a fair initial question. Like, no. Likely no one who follows you thinks Trump is stable. @GSemiotics which doesn't heal anything. I feel like you may have been able to infer that but I wanted to be sure. @GSemiotics just anywhere. I'm from a nowhere place like that. In the cities people just smack the problems with fancy bandaids. @Chris_arnade Bill Maher had a segment about this a couple of months ago. Same no sympathy vein. Left confusion is left ignorance. @Chris_arnade beautiful eulogies and obituaries celebrating life. No non profits, no education funds. Just death and attempting to move on) @Chris_arnade imagine saying this about the heroin epidemic in the suburbs. (Specifically suburbs: where I grew up there weren't @Chris_arnade well, at least this disdain isn't completely obscured. That said, I'm feeling at a loss as far how to address this. @lawgirl @Chris_arnade I wish this didn't resonate as much as it does. Suppose that could have been the start though. I'm often surprised at how poor my attention span is in spite of growing up with 56K modems. @adamjohnsonNYC shouldn't be improved. @adamjohnsonNYC I question whether this is solvent.

PROTAGONIST killed his father. Like some how he would have gotten a hold of some yellow cake for the Galicia separatist movement in Spain and isn't afraid to use it.

I didn't vote for Trump but this does @kimberlyyyo that sounds terrible.

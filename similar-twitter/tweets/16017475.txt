I have no foolproof solutions, but a more iterative approach might help? Build on prior knowledge but be ready to revise conclusions. 7. Sometimes the reverse is true also. In a well-reported story, the conclusion should hold even if some nonessential details are wrong. 6. A story can be 100% factually accurate (narrowly true) and yet basically be BS. Many stories driven by "the narrative" have this problem. 5. Still, this gets into some hiccups for how the press evaluates itself. There can be too much focus on narrow truth vs. broader truth. 4. In general, the correct response is to disengage and not let the other guy dictate the terms of the debate. 3. This is challenging to deal with. You can be 85% right and a skilled debater can usually pivot the conversation to the 15% you got wrong. 2. Buried among the many bad arguments there are usually a few grains of truth, i.e. examples of stories the media really did screw up. 1. Spicer (&amp; Trump) are skilled at what we used to call “the spread” in high school debate. Make a lot of dubious arguments really fast. Because of this, Trump can make out pretty well if ~45% of the country supports him. But bottom will fall out quickly if it's only 35-40%. Hard to overstate how clustering/gerrymandering of Dems helps GOP. Trump lost pop vote but won median congressional district by ~3.5 points. But it's a BIG adjustment to go from underdog/insurgent to incumbent. One of the reasons presidents often struggle in their first 1-2 years. Not unique to Trump, btw. Reagan, Clinton, Obama were also underdogs in their way. True pretty much whenever the presidency changes parties. Trump benefited from always being seen as an underdog during the campaign. The minute you become president, you aren't an underdog anymore. Women's March numbers likely to way exceed Tea Party overall. But curious what numbers will look like in small &amp; medium-sized towns. Here's a list of Tea Party crowd sizes from April 2009.

People believed that "blue wall" crap. They were caught very flat-flooted on the Comey letter. Not an easy thing to respond to, but they didn't have much of a strategy at all.

If not for Comey/Russia, she probably wins them all by ~2 points &amp; strategy looks great. Clinton would still have lost the Electoral College with both MI &amp; WI.

The business interests story is less threatening to Trump's legitimacy than the popular vote &amp; recount stuff. @jackshafer: Hamilton tweets not in the same ballpark -- or the same hemisphere -- as calling the legitimacy of the election into question.

(A: probably herding.) https://t.co/NbJX64TzUA https://t.co/NJsmKmxOSs @jpodhoretz: Same could be true if Clinton wins. RT @538politics: Not enough people paying attention to a transit strike in Philly that could hurt turnout among black voters. https://t.co/… @jonathanchait: If Hillary beats her public polls, we'll want to see what states it happened in to untangle EV, Comey, ground game, etc. @jonathanchait: Our model's job is to reflect the public polls and I think it does a super good job with that. Of course EV may be impt too. @jonathanchait: None of the models account for early voting, though. Maybe they should, but that's not why they differ. It's possible—I think likely, to be honest—that a model should be fairly conservative on swings early on but aggressive late. Actually, one exception—there's good, healthy debate about how aggressive a model should be about chasing down swings early in the campaign. People don't debate the premises of 538 model (e.g. state errors correlated, undecideds=uncertainty). They just don't like the conclusions. But mostly it's the Electoral College. Clinton underperforming Obama's 2012 forecast by *4 points* in the Midwest.… https://t.co/N76MCn5MdC Also, Obama had 49% of the vote, whereas Clinton has 45%. About 3x more undecideds. Clinton's polling is MUCH weaker than Obama's in the swing states. People seem to miss this. https://t.co/EspnywJDcv https://t.co/DEARB8vqvU @dsquareddigest: A better approximation is how likely a model would have regarded a given map (all 50 states together) as being. still, n=1 @dsquareddigest: People will surely do that, but it won't say much about the models. The argument is over how state outcomes are correlated. And the 538 model puts more chips on weird outcomes:
HRC wins pop vote, loses Elect. College
HRC wins but with a funky combo of states, etc. Loosely speaking:
538 more right if HRC gets &lt;=285 EV or &gt;=375 EV
Others more right if she gets 300 EV to 350
in-between areas sort of a tie One reason model evaluation is tricky: 538 gives Trump the best chance of winning, period, but also Clinton the best chance of winning AZ. Clinton went from having a 6-point lead pre-Comey to a 3-point lead post-Comey. https://t.co/LgJkfYpZCk Cause and effect definitely *not* totally clear, but Clinton went from 81% in our forecast pre-Comey letter to 65%… https://t.co/djnPajRP56 @nataliemjb: And we show readers every step in the adjustments for transparency, even though it's given rise to misinterpretation here. @nataliemjb: ...and to avoid our state-by-state forecasts from either bouncing around too much or being out of date. @nataliemjb: So you can't cite the trend adjustment in isolation. It's part of the model's strategy to balance recency &amp; quality of polls. @nataliemjb: In the primaries, for instance, we don't use a trend line adjustment, but weight more recent polls VERY aggressively instead. @nataliemjb: If we didn't use the trend line adjustment, we'd weight recent polls more heavily instead, and still wind up at C+2 or +3. …I think people would be interpreting the evidence differently if Rubio or Kasich were in Trump's position in the polls. What's weird is that it seems kind of *intuitive* and *obvious* based on the polls that Clinton is favored but Trump has a shot... Our model weights these recent, high-quality polls most heavily. That's how we get Clinton as a 2:1 favorite. https://t.co/QBaQ5SBboi Today's high-quality state polls? Not awful for HRC. But she's underperfoming Obama in all 5 states:

FL—Tie

That's just not a good representation of what the data says. But, she has a lead. Average of 6 most recent live-caller national polls has Clinton +2.3 points. 538's popular vote estimate is Clinton +2.9. @dsquareddigest @delong @Econodel @mattyglesias: Whereas if we wrongly assumed state errors are uncorrelated, we'd have Trump at &lt;5% or so. @dsquareddigest @delong @Econodel @mattyglesias: If we arbitrarily gave Clinton another point, we'd still have Trump in the 25-30% range. @dsquareddigest @delong @Econodel @mattyglesias: We have Clinton doing maybe 1 point worse across the board and a lot of states are close. @dsquareddigest @delong @Econodel @mattyglesias: The differences are 80-90% because of variance, 10-20% trend. When you go low, I go high 80% of the time, and knee you in the balls the other 20% of the time. @ryangrim: The article made clear you have **no fucking idea** what you're talking about. That's why you contract people **ahead of time**. @ryangrim: Very professional of you not bother asking me for comment ahead of time. So unbelievably lazy. And especially don't be lazy when your untested assumptions happen to validate your partisan beliefs. The philosophy behind 538 is: Prove it. Doesn't mean we can't be wrong (we're wrong all the time). But prove it. Don't be lazy. The problem is that we're doing this in a world where people—like @ryangrim—don't actually give a shit about evidence and proof. That's what makes a model a useful scientific &amp; journalistic tool. It's a way to understand how elections work. Not just about the results. We constantly write about our assumptions and **provide evidence** for why we think they're the right ones. https://t.co/IhLKXdxGGK There's a reasonable range of disagreement. But a model showing Clinton at 98% or 99% is not defensible based on the empirical evidence. Not just an issue in elections models. Failure to understand how risks are correlated is part of what led to the 2007/8 financial crisis. If you haven't carefully tested how errors are correlated between states, for example, your model will be way overconfident. There are also a gajillion ways to make a model overconfident, whereas it's pretty hard to make one overconfident. Every model makes assumptions but we actually test ours based on the evidence. Some of the other models are barley even empirical. It's wrong to show Clinton with a 6-point lead (as per HuffPo) when **almost no national poll shows that**. Doesn't reflect the data. The reason we adjust polls for the national trend is because **that's what works best emperically**. It's not a subjective assumption. This article is so fucking idiotic and irresponsible. https://t.co/VNp02CvxlI You're welcome to say "Clinton will beat polls because turnout!" but don't confuse that for polls themselves, which show a competitive race.

That's why you look at averages. When a poll shows big swings, it's often a sign the pollster trusts its data -- a good thing to do -- instead of herding or self-censoring. Republicans have suddenly forgotten about the IBD/TIPP poll. And Democrats suddenly discovered methodological flaws with the ABC/Post poll. The FBI story also broke at the exact time when the media was eager for a dramatic twist/complication in the "Clinton coasts" narrative. Key thing to look at is whether Clinton's vote share declines from current ~46%. If Trump's vote rises, may not have to do with FBI stuff. Betting markets have Clinton win probability falling from 81%-&gt;76% post FBI. Equivalent to anticipating roughly a 1-point drop in the polls. But this is very different from the July story, for some obvious (doesn't directly implicate HRC, based on what we know so far) reasons. As a benchmark Clinton lost 2 points when Comey made news in July. If she lost 2 points now, Trump's chances would increase to about 30/35%. Here's today's Election Update!

https://t.co/HDAHsYAfu8 GOP Senate candidates are outperforming the top of the ticket by 4-5 points on average. https://t.co/7WJPZCGcKh Another source of uncertainty: a lot of disagreement among pollsters about both the level (big or smallish Clinton lead) *and* the trend. For instance, how much polling errors are correlated from state to state matters 100x more than what (for example) the IBD/TIPP poll says. People spend **way** too much time litigating individual polls, when they should be thinking about the risk of systemic polling error. McMullin chances in Utah keep rising -- up to 20% in polls-only and 32% in our now-cast: https://t.co/xoNQ6IlrfJ So it's complicated:

I think people/models are overconfident that like PA or NH exactly will be 270. Could very easily be FL or even NC. Also, I get worried about herding when polling forms this tight a range.

Polls-only *deliberately does not make that assumption*. @JustinWolfers: Other models were even more aggressive in August, though, especially as compared to 538 polls-plus &amp; betting markets. @JustinWolfers: You probably also know that most models in low-n environments are overfit and overconfident. We work hard to avoid that. @JustinWolfers: Our models (now-cast, polls-only, plus-plus) make progressively more complex assumptions. That's part of showing our work. @JustinWolfers: Still lazy. But it's interesting that prediction markets have tracked 538 polls-plus *almost exactly* thru the campaign. @JustinWolfers: I'm just going to say this once, but you make some very lazy critiques. Build a model yourself and see how this stuff works. @538politics: muting This is the key bit, I think. People may be underestimating the chance of a big polling error (in either direction): https://t.co/Afd0ywn09L This uncertainty cuts in both directions, so we probably also give higher odds to (say) Clinton winning 400+ EV than other models. 2. Lots of undecideds = more uncertainty.
3. Model based on elections since 1972, not just recent ones where polls have been super accurate. 1. Our model views polling errors as highly correlated across states, so Electoral College won't protect HRC if there's a big polling miss.

—Bannon seems to have gained influence at Conway's expense. —Trump was down 5-6 points before the weekend.

The margin of error is high, so to speak. Here's my overview of where we stand heading into the first debate: https://t.co/4WWH2cX4Go This cuts both ways, BTW. Our model likely also gives a better chance than others to Clinton winning by 6%+. It's bullish on uncertainty. And second, much larger undecided and 3rd party vote this year.  Leading 48-46 is considerably safer than leading 42-40. First, Obama was overperforming in swing states. So a 2% national lead was equivalent to 3% Electoral College lead. NOT true for Clinton. Clinton's ~2% lead over Trump is a lot less safe than Obama's was at similar junctures over Romney. Here's why... What's different though is that ABC/Post have both Clinton and Trump in the mid-40s. Johnston/Stein may be losing steam. 538 model has Clinton +2 nationally, exactly matching the new ABC/Post poll. Result shouldn't be a surprise. https://t.co/i56eIeQqDN @DinoStraciatela: I'd guess so, yeah.... It's a tight race.

Has tracked 538 very closely (now 63% Clinton). @conorsen: The version of our model that uses non-polling data -- polls-plus -- shows the same thing as the one that uses polls only. Instead, there are a lot of *implicit* and *unexamined* assumptions that the race will shift back to Clinton. That's dangerous. To put it another way, the burden of proof should be on people who DON'T show a competitive race, because that requires MORE assumptions. It's not just 538. Simple, relatively assumption-free polling averages, such as RCP and @TPM, also show a very close race. …but people spend a lot of time denying &amp; cherry-picking their way around the 1-2 points part, which suggests they're not thinking clearly. If your premise is "Clinton's only 1-2 points ahead right now, but she's a fairly heavy favorite despite that…", I'll hear your case out… Can you invent an alternate set of assumptions wherein Clinton is a heavy favorite? Sure. But that's despite the polls, not because of them. The best (empirically) set of assumptions apart from the polls, that elections are driven by economic conditions, ALSO suggest a close race. Our forecast has it close right now, with Clinton as the narrow favorite, because that's what the polls show. It's as simple as that. Never seen otherwise-smart people in so much denial about something as they are about Trump's chances.

Where Clinton's gaining ground relative to Obama are a lot of places like TX, AZ, GA that aren't quite ready to be swing states yet. Here's why Clinton's Electoral College position is considerably worse than Obama's: https://t.co/jnXTHigneb https://t.co/stT7QghR54 Compare the WashPost and NYT leads.

(via @UpshotNYT) https://t.co/iuRvupXv7B FWIW, I think I could also predict with high accuracy which news outlets are more or less likely to characterize Debate 1 as Trump victory. My baseline assumptions for Debate 1:
—Pundits/reporters 60-70% likely to say Trump wins.
—Instant polls 60-70% likely to say Clinton wins. "Expectations are low," said Area Man Responsible For Setting Expectations. Not sure it was wise of Clinton to way cut back her ads in Colorado. https://t.co/rapl0eqJCA https://t.co/INabWG7xov Caveat is that Clinton hasn't been on the trail, so hasn't really had a chance to rebut/change the storyline. She's resuming campaign today. Clinton had been on a downward trajectory since mid-August, but got some pretty decent polls last week. This week's have been rough. With more polls, effect of Clinton's bad news cycles this weekend becoming easier to spot. https://t.co/WLXtJovjYd https://t.co/8M8OKntmB6 @EsotericCD: Yeah, it's about half a Clinton slump and half a Trump surge, as best as I can figure. @chrislhayes: I don't mean rank-and-file Democrats, but certain D-leaning polling types (who I'm not looking to pick fights with… yet.) There's still a lot of denial among Democrats about how tight the race has become, despite abundant evidence from high-quality polls. The big question is whether the race is "out of equilibrium" now—reflecting temporary conditions—or if instead this is the "new normal". 6/6 Under this theory, though, voter enthusiasm for Clinton could rebound a lot if she does well at the debates. Raises the stakes further. 5/ Usually you're battle complacency when you're ahead, but benefit from a bandwagon effect. It evens out. Maybe not now for Clinton though. 4/ …on the other hand, she hardly has that winner's halo. A lot of bad news cycles lately. Not a lot of public appearances. Declining polls. 3/ …on the one hand, most voters think/assume that Clinton is going to win. That can de-motivate turnout, or shift votes to 3rd parties. 2/ Some of Clinton's decline reflects an increasing enthusiasm gap. She may be getting the worst of both worlds right now. Here's what I mean… More mostly bad news in polls this AM for Clinton, whose chances are down to 63%. https://t.co/WLXtJodIzD https://t.co/ptYAT144mC Trump : Clinton :: Bush : Gore. https://t.co/ucqpUJJifv There's now a 51% chance of the Chicago Cubs winning the World Series and/or Donald Trump becoming president. https://t.co/0gFr2lriVq The *good* argument for Dems not panicking is that:
1—News flow has been very negative for Clinton
2—Despite that, she's *probably* winning Obama outperformed his national numbers in Iowa and Nevada. Clinton underperforming hers. That actually makes a pretty big difference. How comfortable can she feel in NH, for instance? Polls all over the place. Swingy state. Trump overperforming in region vs. Romney/McCain. Without those states, Clinton has 273 electoral votes but there's no margin for error. Lose any one of NH/PA/WI/MI/CO/VA and Trump is POTUS. Here's what the map looks like now, with a 2-3% national lead for Clinton. FL/OH/NC/IA/NV all toss-ups. https://t.co/bkl3YNbRGK We got a lot of crap from some quarters when we wrote this 2 weeks ago but it's looking prescient right about now: https://t.co/3cc97uTtAi It's not totally clear how much Clinton's "bad weekend" affected the polls. But clear Trump still gaining ground. https://t.co/mWX5COfJn6 That's NOT to predict Trump will finish well (as Leave did). But I see people making excuses to treat a clear possibility as a remote one. As others have mentioned, there are echoes of Brexit here. Clinton's narrowing lead over Trump a lot like Remain's over Leave at this point. In past years, media consensus would look at recent polls and say "it's a tossup". This year, attitude is still "Clinton's got this". @DinoStraciatela: Clinton up 2.5% in polls-plus, 3.4% in polls-only. But polls-plus is more confident, enough to cancel out that difference. @DinoStraciatela: Not exactly but more or less, yes. @JustinWolfers: Betting markets agree with us, though. Trump odds 9/14:

Having a few speedy polls in the mix=nice balance. So...I miss the old days when we had national tracking polls that covered 3-4 days, instead of 5-7 days, even though they drove people nuts. Still, some outlets are managing the balance a LOT better than others. So news orgs can do better than just throw their hands up. 11/11 It's not an easy problem—do you ease up on Clinton because you don't have enough bandwidth to fully cover Trump? I hope not. 10/ Arguably the reverse would be better. Focus on fewer stories but in more depth. Some examples of this, e.g. @fahrenthold, but not many. 9/ The compromise winds up being that media covers Trump broadly, but thinly. Many vectors of reporting but not much sustained focus. 8/ Trump gets harsh coverage. But it can't, or doesn't, fully scale up to his candidacy. He's treated as a 7 mitt when he's really a 50... 7/ But Trump is a 50-mitt candidate! There's everything: corruption, racism, lying, fitness for office. Like nothing we've ever seen before. 6/ Clinton is in fact treated by media as a 5-mitt candidate. Sometimes the balance is off. But overall she deserves—and gets—much scrutiny. 5/ On this scale, Hillary Clinton measures 5 mitts. Some stories are exaggerated. But there's a lot there! Much more than Romney or Obama. 4/ Obama is/was also about 1 mitt. There are a few issues around the margin—e.g. Rezko. But overall, a pretty clean bill of health. 3/ Let's invent a unit called the mitt, after Mitt Romney, which measures a candidate's scandalousness. Romney himself=1 mitt (pretty low). 2/ Here's a math-y way to think about the problem critics have with media coverage of Clinton and Trump. Maybe it will provide some clarity. 1/ Don't get your hopes up @smod2016 https://t.co/4LNLIHDEwh Really should be a fake @nypost cover generator somewhere because I don't think this one was worth 20 minutes tbh. https://t.co/IiHWbIP1Tk RT @jodyavirgan: New @FiveThirtyEight elections pod!

Folks were slow to recognize race tightening but not clear it's STILL tightening now. Polls over the past 7-10 days had shown Trump's momentum stalling out. All before deplorables/pneumonia though. https://t.co/0DZuHVmBli It's all a bit unpredictable. Certainly ways it could turn out badly for Clinton. But also not obvious how it motivates votes for Trump. 9/9 Trump benefits if there are recurring problems, more serious than disclosed so far. But can't be so serious they force Clinton to quit. 8/ But on the remote chance Clinton has SERIOUS problems, as fewer swamps allege, she could drop out, which probably doesn't help Trump. 7/ Clinton has the bigger base. She might not mind a big partisan fight. Polling suggests some of her recent slide is due to enthusiasm gap. 6/ Trump is older than Clinton, not in obviously great shape, and even less transparent. Not in a great position to press the health issue. 5/ …then it probably devolves in a few days to a big partisan food-fight. Trump and/or media could overreach, motivating Clinton supporters. 4/ That speculation is probably silly, but it illustrates a potential limitation for Trump. If there's nothing more to the story... 3/ But less than half of the decline was to Trump. Instead, Kaine/Biden/Sanders gained ground. Gamblers speculating Clinton could drop out. 2/ Clinton's win probability fell by 4-5% at betting markets today on pneumonia/"overheating" news. A strong reaction, as these things go. 1/ RT @SeanTrende: Hypothesis: The correlation between one's interpretation of Clinton's stumble and their prior support for Clinton or Trump… Lots of new polls this morning but no change in forecast.

Almost half the Hispanic population lives in California or Texas, which won't be competitive in a close race. If Clinton gains big among Hispanics but loses among whites, that could yield an Electoral College/popular vote split in Trump's favor. Also, it's much better if pollsters are willing to publish "outliers" (or results that defy conventional wisdom) than to self-censor them. Most bad polling analysis stems from people's desire to take the most recent/most hyped poll as the gospel truth, instead of averaging data. @realDonaldTrump: Proper attribution! 👍 @realDonaldTrump: 😕 I believe Trump is referring to an Ipsos poll of Ohio—which we list and some other sites don't. Not our poll though. https://t.co/f1MUrlfitY Our polling average in Ohio—based on other people's polls!—is Clinton 41.8, Trump 39.8. Close but Clinton up a hair. https://t.co/1Zp1BGrswV Trump campaign is apparently citing a @FiveThirtyEight poll showing him ahead in Ohio. There isn't one—we don't do our own horse race polls. @JamesFallows: That's totally fair. Probably better to describe them as anti-Trump and anti-Clinton cycles of coverage. Both campaigns would love for one of those friendly coverage cycles to coincide with 1) Sept. 26 first debate; 2) Nov. 8 election. (fin) Also consider campaigns' behavior in this light. Trump encouraging comeback narrative. Clinton laying low instead of pissing into wind. 13/ This usually becomes less of an issue as election drags on &amp; voters get more locked in. Still many undecided voters this year though. 12/ Taken together, these tics in coverage may contribute to the sine-wave pattern we've seen so far in the polls. 11/ https://t.co/XhiK2ZDvwT That has the opposite effect—in technical terms, it's a negative feedback rather than a positive feedback. 10/ But the media is also eager for a competitive, shifting race. So being in a stronger position in the polls makes you more of a target. 9/ This creates the potential for minor, self-perpetuating ripples of "momentum". Better polls beget better coverage begets better polls... 8/ First, polls are used as evidence for the shifting narratives. Sometimes justifiably—the race has tightened lately—but sometimes not. 7/ These waves of press coverage have a relationship with the polls.

Most plausible story is that Trump has regained 1-2 points over the past week or two. Slow enough that it can get lost in the noise a bit.

Trump's favorability is only 34%. Needs #NeverHillary voters to turn out to keep it respectable. If he's still down a bunch on Nov. 7 not that hard to imagine Trump saying (implicitly or explicitly) "you know what, don't bother to vote". In USC/LATimes poll, Trump supporters' likelihood of voting has fallen a bunch over past week. His "rigged" message may depress his turnout. Is it likely that Clinton will win by 12 points? 16? No, not especially. But she's up 8 now. Perhaps no more *unlikely* than Trump winning.

Pretty neutral in OH &amp; FL. @allahpundit: No doubt that FL is the best poll of the bunch for Trump, though, and PA is the best for Clinton. @allahpundit: Q has like a 4-point GOP house effect, so basically it's showing Clinton +4 or 5, which seems about right. Quinnipiac numbers look about like what you'd expect, given overall state of race + Q's fairly heavy Republican lean this cycle. Remember how we obsessed for weeks about the VP picks? Now pretty much everyone's forgotten about Pence and Kaine. https://t.co/nRF1IzDEQl None of this matters nearly as much as what's happening in FL, OH, etc. Just means electoral college could get ugly if Trump loses by 8%+. Obama got 45% of the vote in Georgia in 2012, 44% in South Carolina. Pretty similar. So, sure, SC might be in play if Clinton's leading GA. Why was Monmouth a big deal?

*Yet. https:… @LPDonovan: Have spent a lot of time up there too. ME-2 is kind of perfect for Trump. The amount of "unskewing" already going on is an extraordinarily bearish indicator for Trump. https://t.co/vZS2U684x5 @allahpundit: That's actually tied for the largest lead Clinton has ever had in that poll. If you average polls-only and polls-plus, Clinton's projected Nov. 8 margin is 5-6%. Roughly equal chance she (i) loses (ii) wins by 10%+. Our long-term models project either a lot (polls-plus) or a little (polls-only) tightening eventually, however. https://t.co/IDN3p4eRau No sign yet of a reversal in Clinton's bounce. Her lead has held steady at ~8% for a few days, per our nowcast. https://t.co/dKIkhZU3SZ We're nearing the point where Clinton has to screw up, or get screwed up by leaks/scandals/gaffes/news, to lose. Not there yet but close. 4/ But at her worst moments, Clinton's image has been almost as bad as Trump's. Not so hard to imagine something that drags it down again. 3/ Trump probably won't "pivot" and even if he tried, the public isn't amnesiac and won't forget everything he's done and said for a year+. 2/ In some sense, the rest of the election is about Clinton and not Trump. Trump's favorables are as bad as ever and perhaps getting worse. 1/ Good chance polls will tighten over the next week or 2 but not much evidence of that yet. People cherry-picking to force the case a bit. Actually it was 'Arrogant',  'Elitist', with a comma.

Need to see where race is 2-3 weeks from now. Clinton at 80% in our polls-only forecast and 74% in polls-plus, close to her all-time highs. https://t.co/pCZX1KIbij @ForecasterEnten: Trump's polling well in Celsius. Those models assume race will tighten some. If you held an election now Trump would get crushed, with GA &amp; AZ as toss-ups per our now-cast. Clinton now 73% to win in our polls-plus model. 78% in polls-only. https://t.co/zo8rbYw56E https://t.co/ULpoCf0ygy Trump has a chance, because he may be able to drag Clinton down to his level. That will be despite rather than because of Trump, however. Perhaps the worst take is the "Trump's actually doing well to only be down by 7!!!" take. He's the least popular major-party nominee ever. @ForecasterEnten: I'd have assumed she was up 9.6. Seems like a Trump surge. Fitness-for-office is both Clinton's largest comparative advantage and—given his indiscipline—the hardest critique for Trump to respond to. There are so many ways to attack Trump that you risk losing the thread unless you focus on 1 or maybe 2 major themes. Obviously helps Clinton that Trump keeps stepping in it. But she deserves some credit for making Trump's fitness-for-office a focal point. Clinton/Democrats have been laser-focused on these attributes since Day 3 of the DNC. It seems to be working. https://t.co/fiMOSc0SBG Our forward-looking models have Clinton's Election Day win probability at around 70%. They want a bit more proof she can sustain her bounce. p.s. If you're going to look at the now-cast, probably better to look at how much a candidate is leading by than her probability of winning. Our now-cast thinks Clinton would win by about 7% if you held the election right now. https://t.co/djsqNajFrh https://t.co/1QGXMiy6qs Fox News poll was conducted Sunday thru Tuesday, so postdates the (already pretty bad for Trump) data we got over the weekend.

And I'm curious about Dallas/Nice/Baton Rouge, which were hard to separate from Comey. All pretty normal. The conventional wisdom has been pretty good about anticipating polling shifts in the general (not so in the primaries). What's seemed to move the polls?
- Trump and Clinton clinching respective nominations
- Comey/FBI/email
- DNC, and to a lesser extent RNC Clinton's large-ish bounce doesn't mean she's sure to win on Nov. 8. But it does suggest that political gravity still applies. So far, Clinton's bounce is bigger than Trump's: https://t.co/PoLqZ1F6g7 ...and possibly also made up some of the ground she lost in July. Question is, can she sustain this for a few weeks? Or is it temporary? In all polls so far, Clinton's improved relative to the pre-convention version of the polls. IOW, she's gotten a larger bump than Trump... Rockies hitting the ball hard but everything is... finding Nimmo. https://t.co/3EgEWjGPp0 Interesting how we've shifted between high tide for Trump (where he's almost tied with Clinton) and low tide (down 5-10%) several times now. Entirely possible that Clinton got a big bounce, but we need more than one poll to confirm it. Lots of polls coming Sun/Mon/Tue I'd imagine. Our "now-cast" has flipped back toward Clinton, but long-term models haven't really budged yet... not enough data. https://t.co/djsqNajFrh @dandrezner: They're new-ish so don't know much about em.

Short answer: 538 model is more aggressive than some others at detecting trends, and there's been a big trend to Trump in polls this month. Why does our forecast love Trump so much? https://t.co/tCvkS2cje5 @dandrezner: That's about where I was drawing the line. Maybe a 30th percentile bounce if you look from 1992 onward. FYI: About 80 or 90% of conventions produce discernible convention bounces, Trump's was in maybe the 30th or 40th percentile of those. @ForecasterEnten We're liveblogging DNC Day 3, which feels awfully high stakes: https://t.co/ce3bh1HJ57 @ForecasterEnten @jbouie: Rigged. We have some thoughts here about Obama's impact on the campaign. Probably still Democrats' biggest asset. https://t.co/2w1n9yKYCs You can get a small-to-medium, Trump-sized convention bounce by moving undecided "leaners" into your column. Lots of undecideds this year. With that said, Trump's convention bounce is meh by historical standards. Seems larger because he was gaining on Clinton before conventions. Lesson seems to be that you can get a convention bounce even with a mediocre convention. https://t.co/Gnyfs0TDAr I seriously wonder if Trump's going especially nuts because the DNC is getting better TV ratings than the RNC. I wonder if Biden makes the full-throttle, Trump-unfit-for-office case tonight. Sanders coalition is unusual too. Not just "liberal Democrats". In fact, many aren't Democrats. More leftist than liberal. Many new voters. But Sanders got 13m people to vote for him. Less than Clinton's 17m. But cobbled together a whole new coalition. https://t.co/XLUbDx8D7E As a horse race, the primary wasn't very close. Clinton established a big lead early and held it.

IIRC, TV ratings aren't too predictive of polling bounces. Still, surprising that DNC &gt;= the Trump show ratings-wise https://t.co/wYDJap34NI Remarkable how *little* discussion there's been about Clinton becoming the first woman nominee of a major party --&gt; https://t.co/JPBx9WuoxN tl;dr: Clinton will probably gain as Sanders voters come home. But NOT a done deal, yet. Among the most important factors in election. (7/7) And Sanders supporters are somewhat irregular voters—especially if they're young, but also if you control for age. So turnout is a risk. (6/ But Sanders holdouts are NOT very fond of the Democratic party. Many are independents. Ergo, Johnson &amp; Stein are real options for them. (5/ To be sure, there's some relatively low-hanging fruit for Clinton here. Lots of Sanders voters that would lean her way in a 2-way race. (4/ But LOTS of Sanders voters are in Johnson/Stein/undecided camp. Maybe 30%, depending on the poll. So party unity stuff is high-stakes. (3/ 90% is what you get if you *force* Sanders voters to choose between Clinton and Trump. No Johnson, Stein, undecided or "won't vote". (2/ Seeing the number everywhere that 90% of Sanders voters back Clinton. It comes from a Pew poll -- Pew is great -- but a bit misleading. (1/ @ClaraJeffery @AmyKNelson: It's basically all California. Here's a longer reflection on mood of the convention tonight. Charged but not the negative vibes others reported. https://t.co/mzBrtRox2Z Live from Philadelphia, it's our Monday night liveblog! 
https://t.co/gKqN3hOonz RT @MileHighBrendan: Here you go, @NateSilver538. I made you a chart. #datajournalism ;) https://t.co/6TeRWxbZaq Unfortunately for Clinton, most vocal boo-ers seem to be in California (or Oklahoma?) delegation, near where TV broadcasts are, stage-right. When the speaker isn't exciting people, they can be quite noticeable. Otherwise they get drowned out. How many people were booing mentions of Hillary? I'd guess 2-5% of the delegates, or something like that. A few loud pockets of people. Big cheers for adopting party platform. This convention may be a shitshow -- most gatherings of Democrats are -- but not yet a clusterfuck. So if people are going to win over the recalcitrant Sanders delegates, it's going to have to be Sanders himself, and maybe Warren. Does seem though that there's much more enthusiasm for pro-Bernie speakers. Nobody paying attention to Steny Hoyer right now, for instance. ...way more pro-Bernie than anti-Hillary. Big cheers for party unity a few minutes ago. Maybe mood has changed in past 20 minutes. Just got to floor, but not seeing same negative vibe from convention that others are repoting. It feels *charged* and unpredictable, but... @davewiner @FiveThirtyEight: Hasn't changed. Our now-cast has Trump ahead, other models are more conservative &amp; still have Clinton up. Sanders supporters aren't consistent Democrats, and turn out at relatively low rates. Sort of a new constiutency. https://t.co/pmBppWODKA One implication is that maybe you'll see bigger swings after conventions, debates, breaking news. But also means a small lead is less safe. A related thought: This year have looked more like elections from 70s/80s/90s. Many undecideds. Polls volatile. Not as steady as 04, 08, 12. Democrats were maybe too complacent about what happened to Clinton's numbers in July. If you go from +7 to +3 in a month, easy to go to -1. If you want to ignore polls for the next 3 weeks that's OK. Polls can be wild during conventions. Trump's bounce pretty average. HOWEVER... *Before* the conventions, Trump had a 35-40% chance of winning, per our models. That's high! Race had already gotten much closer. Here's my longer take on the polls, post Trump's convention bounce: https://t.co/YcUecSkpl4 RT @FiveThirtyEight: Interested in working with us? We have lots of open positions (including internships)! https://t.co/oQKfnIH4fH This looks prescient right now --&gt; https://t.co/tTKs9udeGj Trump voters are loyal Republicans, but aren't very conservative.
Bernie voters are very liberal, but aren't partisan/loyal Democrats. @fierman: Polls-plus is the most accurate, historically. But the now-cast is fun if you like to panic! Trump trailed by around 3 points in our forecasts a week ago. Typical convention bounce is 4 points. So you end up at Trump +1 or so. It's not Trump's convention bounce per se that should worry Dems. That's pretty normal. It's how it became so close to begin with. CLINTON still leads in our polls-plus model, which adjusts for Trump's convention bounce. https://t.co/zo8rbYw56E https://t.co/J0G2D5PHxK TRUMP now leads in 538's now-cast, our estimate of what would happen in an election today. https://t.co/djsqNajFrh https://t.co/7DvrdieHOw RT @jazayerli: The #Munich shooting disappeared off the media radar so fast after we learned he wasn't Muslim that most people don't know h… RT @AthertonKD: Holy shit.

RT @ForecasterEnten: Tim Kaine is a mainstream Democrat across three ideological measures. https://t.co/JMy3Ky5MPA https://t.co/n3JXqXIpj3 Don't think people are really grasping how plausible it is that Trump could become president.

https://t.co/46AP5dXjl3 Clinton now a 72% favorite in Virginia per our polls-plus forecast, which makes an adjustment for her VP pick. https://t.co/9qzslOiIDg Agree with this.

If you're really up by 7% nationally, as Clinton was at her peak, your swing state polls should be excellent. Not a mix of good and meh. It's not a huge decline. Our model "thinks" Clinton went from leading by 6-7% nationally, to more like 4-5%. The key (as is often the case) is the trendlines.

https://t.co/m41jRUF6ec Maine's 2nd congressional district, where Trump is right now, looks quite competitive per our model: https://t.co/uewiWKhPm7 But also, Trump's really underperforming in red states. Winning Texas by 7% instead of 17%, for instance. That impacts the national numbers. Some of it is probably noise. Just today, Clinton got great state polls but some not-so-great national polls, reversing the earlier trend. I also talk a little about the alleged state-national poll discrepancy here:
https://t.co/ouDicqYnR0 Trump has a 19% chance of becoming president, according to our polls-only model, and 26% according to polls-plus. https://t.co/zo8rbYw56E Hey y'all our 2016 forecast is here. https://t.co/WLXtJovjYd Those aren't even outliers! 
In a 600-person poll, the margin of error, if Clinton's really up 7%, runs from Clinton +15% to Trump +1%. If Clinton's up 7% nationally, we're going to see some swing state polls where she's up 12%. And others where she's up 2%. That's normal. I expected Clinton to be WINNING Utah, not down 3 points down there. What's wrong with her campaign? https://t.co/GfJQx5YyeA It's "worth it" though because Trump could easily win an electoral vote in Maine's 2nd district and Clinton could easily win Nebraska's 2nd. Tonight's the night when I stay up all night programming because Maine and Nebraska split their damn vote by congressional district. 🎉 Some personal news: I think I left my wallet in Jeremy Corbyn's shadow cabinet, it was pretty dark in there, has anyone seen it?

More diversity in Brexit polls, at least, and some did well. I get way more worried when there's lockstep agreement among the polls. That often reflects herding and *reduces* accuracy. A pet peeve of mine is when people get annoyed by the polls because they disagree with one another. Some degree of disagreement is healthy! Right now, the battleground state polls aren't as good for Clinton as the national polls, with Florida being a potential exception. The bad news for Trump is that a poll showing him 5 points down is considered good news for Trump.

Plus his ground game is way behind. Usually it goes the other way, and the GOP candidate gains 1 or 2% in likely voter surveys. (Sometimes more than that in midterm years). Interesting that Clinton gains 2 points, on net, in going from registered to likely voters in this survey. https://t.co/qWpU4u82xE Not only is Trump not pivoting—he seems to think the primaries proved pivoting is for losers and that he shouldn't change a thing. /5 Trump can win: it's early, polls fluctuate, Clinton has problems. But can he win without a change of course? Recent data says maybe not. 4/ In the primaries, Trump had the element of surprise, ran gadget plays. Now? Clinton's seen his playbook and had 6-9 months to prepare. 3/ In the primaries, Trump just had to hold on to his plurality and keep opponents off-balance. Now? He's behind &amp; base isn't big enough. 3/ In a 17-way primary, Trump's ability to dominate every news cycle paid dividends. With just 2 candidates, not as helpful, can be harmful. 2/ Trump, by all appearances, learns by rote rather than being an abstract thinker, and I think he learned some bad habits in the primaries. 1/ Sanders probably lost leverage by holding on too long. In past few weeks, both primary &amp; general election voters have moved toward Clinton. Sanders won 20 of 30 states/territories where non-Hispanic whites are 2/3 or more of the population. Clinton won 24 of 26 where they aren't. Combined primary turnout will wind up being 61-62m votes, breaking the record of 58-59m in 2008. Crazy year, but at least people are voting. An outside chance Democrats will surpass Republicans based on uncounted ballots in California, but don't think they'll quite get there. Republicans with ~30.7m votes counted in primaries and caucuses this year versus ~30.0m for Democrats. Will wind up being very close. Could very easily wind up with an outcome like Clinton 47%, Trump 41%, Johnson 10%, Stein/others 2%, or something in that vicinity. That Trump's only getting ~38% of the vote in polls (and Clinton only ~43%) is unusual and underappreciated. https://t.co/7z7bhsulcM Reminder: this asshole, who's bankrolling lawsuits against journalists reporting on Trump, is on Facebook's board.

Final map will probably look like this (via @270toWin). Clinton would beat Sanders 399-139 in Electoral College. https://t.co/yWE8hGZwty Polls showed Sanders only ~5% down with Hispanics. If they're having trouble representing the Hispanic vote, big implications for November. That's a bit of an outlier, but Clinton is winning Hispanic-majority counties in CA about 65-35 overall so far, similar to other states. In Imperial County, California, highest Hispanic % in the state, Clinton is leading 74-24%. https://t.co/iqS2UQESmu Tricky to figure out where California vote will end up. Sanders will almost certainly close, but not enough to win. Wild guess: Clinton +14? Polls last week had Clinton up by about 12% in the early vote in California. She leads it by about 25% instead. But winner-take-all rules gave Bush a crushing delegate lead, and McCain had more to lose by hanging on than Sanders. IIRC, McCain trailed Bush by only ~10% in the popular vote when he dropped out. Closer than Sanders got to Clinton. https://t.co/PjGXpTJXV5 Seems possible Democrats are sick of Sanders's arguments over process, as Republicans got sick of Cruz in April.

Johnson, now polling at 8%, is more likely to fall than rise. A good guess is 4-5% by Election Day. That understates the uncertainty, though.

Pollsters can do demographic weighting, etc. But they may be MISrepresented. (4/4) But Democrats have all the hard-to-poll groups. Hispanics, blacks, young voters, new voters. Polls may have trouble finding them. (3/ In theory, the Democratic race should be easier to poll. Fairly stable 2-candidate race instead of wacky free-for-all. (2/ One thing that surprises/worries me is how polls have been less accurate in the Democratic primaries than in the GOP primaries. (1/ Contra the conventional wisdom, the polls actually had a pro-Trump bias (in a statistical sense) in the GOP primary. https://t.co/s5u9Z3chn3 Overall, the polls are still basically pointing us in the right direction, but '14 and '16 not as good as '08-'12. https://t.co/XwgeK8ccmA Which polls have been most accurate recently? Marist and Monmouth have done real well. Also Fox News and Quinnipiac. https://t.co/uJ845sChJe We just released a new set of pollster ratings, incorporating results from the 2014 midterms and 2016 primaries. https://t.co/Kbd5vqOJM4 So in California, our regression model has Clinton winning by 10% if you have a Hispanic variable. But Sanders winning by 3% if you don't. It's hard to account for Clinton's performance in Arizona, Nevada, Florida and Texas unless she's doing pretty well with Hispanic voters. "Welp, she got 55% of the vote and the clear majority of elected delegates, but let's give it to the 74-year-old white guy!". My favorite part of Sanders’s underwear-gnomes strategy to flip superdelegates is how Clinton's voters are magically totally chill with it. Not sure anyone really has a good read on the Latino vote. Sanders could win California or lose by 20%+ depending on how that goes for him. Lots of disagreement in California polls, but Clinton's up 7 over Sanders in our polling average. https://t.co/aGdSOsyAPs And not hard to imagine 3rd-party vote being way higher than usual given unprecedented unpopularity of major-party candidates. Johnson/Weld probably *should* be included in polls, though. If they're polling at 5-10%, that's definitely enough to affect the outcome. We're struggling on what to do about Johnson too.

Meaning, polls oscillate between showing a toss-up and mid/high single-digit Dem lead, everyone gets a little carried away with the swings. An observation–not a prediction–but the path of the general election polls so far in 2016 remind me a lot of the tedious 2008 &amp; 2012 cycles. @jayrosen_nyu: There were lots of important primaries and debates in March; April was pretty dull.

Obama has mostly kept his powder dry, but he can be a big force for party unity later on. An overlooked (if not terribly surprising) data point is that ~75% of Sanders supporters have a favorable view of President Obama. On 2) — the race is not at a state of equilibrium.

Team Sanders has been antagonistic toward Clinton. Team Clinton has played prevent defense, avoided engagement. 2/ Bigger epistemological gap. Clinton and Obama were both liberal policy wonks and incrementalists. Sanders is calling for a "revolution". 1/ This is a good starting point -- 2008 was much nastier than 2016 overall -- but also some important differences. https://t.co/Z10SwSFtQv Subtract then re-add the superdelegates then mutiply that by how much birds like him. https://t.co/SudV0sH3Fx https://t.co/3qIH7BXfPj Both these things can be true:
1. Sanders's performance has been really impressive.
2. The Democratic primary hasn't really been close. Clinton's popular vote margin over Sanders (12.7%) is similar to the margins by which Eisenhower beat Stevenson in '52 and '56. @stevesingiser @Taniel: Roughly speaking, holding a primary expands turnout by 4x.

Whereas many Sanders voters defect to undecided (and a few to Trump). Of course, that could change if she wraps up nomination. 2/ In fact, most of the reason Sanders has better general elex numbers than Clinton is because almost all her voters support him vs. Trump. 1/ Clinton's numbers among Democrats look good/fine. The trick is that many Sanders voters are independents, so easy to miss their importance. In a matchup against Trump, 55% of Sanders voters support Clinton, 15% Trump. That leaves a big 30% chunk undecided or voting for "other".

Doesn't have to be your final answer. But it's a great starting point. Provides discipline. An irony is that our early Trump forecasts weren't based on a statistical model. Just a guesstimate that I got stubborn anchoring myself to.

https://t.co/lOvqeVze6w https://t.co/QzfrnYGGGg Neither the @HillaryClinton nor the @BernieSanders twitter feeds have ever used the word "liberal".
https://t.co/867rwVVEFE ∴ if Clinton has general election problems with Sanders voters, it may show up in her numbers with independents rather than with Democrats. Based on states with exit polls, Clinton has won Democrats by 29% so far, but lost independents voting in Dem primaries by 30% to Sanders. After tonight, Sanders will need to win the remaining states by ~35% to claim a pledged delegate majority. Sanders won Washington by 46 points, leads in Oregon by "only" 10. Difference between open caucus (great format for him) and closed primary. Don't think I'd bet on it at even money, but there's a decent chance Dems could wind up with more total primary votes than GOP this year. Our demographic model expects a clear win for Bernie in Oregon tonight, even though the only poll had Clinton ahead. The Democratic race has been quite stable for a long time, in other words. Not much momentum. All these recent states are right in line with demographic forecasts, which had Clinton +2 in KY for instance. https://t.co/PosEpRdZ3N Also, the sense Sanders supporters have that the system is rigged against them could be harder than other grievances to overcome. Many Sanders backers are left-of-center but *not* loyal Democrats (instead, they're independents). That could make reconciliation harder.

Overall, the FiveThirtyEight "polls-only" model has called 51 of 56 (91%) races correctly this year. "Polls-plus" has called 50 of 56 (89%). @CarlBialik: https://t.co/qXfKM6PovD https://t.co/UjMI7voRoN Both tend to treat lessons drawn from a small number of recent elections as immutable laws of politics. Polling is more robust to change. In some important ways, the "fundamentals" from political science models resemble "conventional wisdom". Maybe a reason to be wary of them. There are lessons from that, but they're almost totally orthogonal to the "data journalism" vs. "traditional journalism" beef. Roughly speaking (I'm generalizing a LOT) polls got Trump *right* while other types of empirical evidence (e.g. endorsements) got him wrong. So let's look at polling *and* let's get out into the field, but less time laundering opinions from the consultant class into a "narrative". BTW, you know what polling is? It's a method of **talking to voters** in a structured way that reduces bias. .@derekwillis: The NYT politics desk was especially hostile to 538 when it tried to do stories that blended data with traditional reporting. ...but in avoiding the previous mistake, you'll often make an equal and opposite mistake in the other direction, or a whole new mistake. Relatedly: It's easy to overcorrect after an "unexpected" event occurs. It's easy to say "we'll never make THAT mistake again..."

Median for GOP primary electorate a whole is ~$80K. For Democrats, about $60K. In exit polls, low education levels are a much stronger predictor of Trump support than low incomes. GOP primary voters are pretty well-off. RT @ForecasterEnten: Sanders cannot wrap his head around the fact that more voters want Clinton to be the nominee than want Sanders. @SeanTrende: "Rubio or someone" is part of the issue. A big Q is why GOP didn't get behind Rubio *specifically* until it was too late. @SeanTrende: The pre-Iowa period was strange. But I think (i) ethanol was a factor (ii) GOPe thought Rubio or someone would emerge later on. I've written a lot about parts 2 (https://t.co/2VIXGxljpY) and 3 (https://t.co/97OMpanU0z). Overdue to do more thinking about part 1. Updated post-Trump priors:
1. Voters are more tribal than I thought.
2. GOP is weaker than I thought.
3. Media is worse than I thought. Not in her wildest dreams did Hillary think GOP would pick a candidate who is both so unpopular and so devastating to conservative movement. @SeanTrende: Not sure that's literally true. I think the trepidations about Cruz blunted anti-Trumpness and enabled strategic folly though. Our "polls-plus" forecast shows a closer race than the "polls-only" version, but also has Trump favored. https://t.co/AWhoKf2lKa Trump now up 8 points in our Indiana polling average, which puts a lot of weight on that new Marist/NBC/WSJ poll: https://t.co/9sJpbRCCFh #YesLabels @stevesingiser: Yeah, the randomness of the MLB and NHL playoffs seems out of balance vs. the regular season.

He actually defends the delegates' right to bypass Trump. https://t.co/2rku8n4dHz We'll see if this changes, but so far Trump has been backed by has-beens and never-weres. Not candidates who have something on the line. Of 47 Republicans in competitive re-election races, only 1 (Tom Reed of NY-23) has backed Trump. https://t.co/Yggr60dp5P RT @FiveThirtyEight: Indiana is weird: https://t.co/31XZrxd9xK https://t.co/vuFukDCUDY If Pence endorses Cruz, interesting because (i) he's a plausible 2020 contender AND (ii) he's up for re-elect this year in a tight race. Here's an important question. If Trump is nominated and loses substantially to Clinton, who are the leading GOP contenders for 2020? To me, the story is more about the impotence and/or incompetence of the GOP "establishment" rather than their embrace of Trump. Cruz doesn't have many endorsements either, although 2x more than Trump. Kasich, despite being "establishment lane", has no more than Trump. Worth remembering that Trump has only a smattering of endorsements. Usually a frontrunner has 100s at this point. https://t.co/VYxFWL97k3 Wow can't believe a college student paid rent by generating millions of dollars for his university with backbreaking labor. Kids these days! Clinton's a favorite against Trump but we'll probably see some moments in the campaign when polls are tight. Almost every election has them. The general election is different. News cycle slower. Just two candidates. Media coverage more even. Way easier to sustain a line of attack. Trump's favorables may improve as he wraps up nomination. But there's also lots of underexplored stuff like this. https://t.co/xtKXBBzxaN I don't think Clinton will beat her own record from 2008, although could be close.

Rubio's -- obviously -- not Reagan, but at least he gives you the electability and the conservatism instead of half a loaf. The conventional wisdom had so much fun mocking Rubio's downfall that I think it missed how big of a break it was for Trump.

https://t.co/tafi3gGd3s https://t.co/2UAaEjNJhH Out of New York, Maryland, Connecticut, Pennsylvania &amp; Delaware, Kasich probably needs to pick 2. Otherwise spread too thin and gets zippo. It's not that the Kasich campaign has a bad strategy. More that it doesn't have *any* strategy.

It's been a spectacularly interesting campaign... @mattdpearce: I think that piece holds up quite well tbh especially compared to the conventional wisdom at the time. https://t.co/a7tofvNokx We've got a good profile up today of @deray's mayoral bid in Baltimore --&gt; https://t.co/etiEzH6g61 Here, at the Appalachian Market on US 9, is exactly where Upstate New York begins IMO. https://t.co/XUgyasLAII https://t.co/Hxq9552xlc By contrast, if GOP nomination were contested under Democratic rules -- proportional, with many superdelegates -- Trump would be toast. 5/ But the *letter* of GOP's rules are haphazardly written, such that Trump might get 51% of the delegates with only 35-40% of the vote. 4/ And in spirit, the rules are supposed to discourage factional, media-driven candidates like Trump who alienate half their party's voters. 3/ It's hard to be a consensus candidate -- ask Marco Rubio -- but the spirit of the GOP rules are supposed to encourage consensus. 2/ Thing is, Trump has exploited oddities of the Republican nomination rules more than he's been exploited by them. 1/ '96 Bulls finished regular season with a 1786 Elo rating. Warriors are at 1787 with one game to go. https://t.co/p7j3w4egip RT @DVNJr: https://t.co/PzZqUAeSDR https://t.co/c6Unvughgi Spieth successfully following Marco Rubio's 3-4-4-3-4-5-6-7-6-5-1-2 plan.
https://t.co/1gJ8NxC78y https://t.co/3iy8UHuprm Not only is New York a closed primary -- it's super closed. Deadline for switching party registration was in *October*. In Wisconsin, Clinton tied Sanders among Democrats despite being blown out overall. And NY demographics much better for Clinton than WI. Ordinarily, I'd be skeptical of polls showing Clinton with a ~15% lead over Sanders in New York, but the closed primary thing is a big deal. Technically Rubio has gained delegates on Kasich since 3/15 because the Alaska GOP restored his delegates to him. https://t.co/OLplvgFQ3y RT @mmurraypolitics: It's a sweep --&gt; Cruz gets 13 of 13 at-large delegates in CO, all of them pledged.

So it's 34 out of 34 for the entir… RT @ForecasterEnten: The idea Clinton won the south because it is conservative isn't true. She won it because she does well with black vote… Also some Dems who like what Bernie stands for but would prefer Clinton as nominee. May flip back to Clinton when she looks more vulnerable. Maybe "momentum" is actually a negative in the Democratic race since it can make your supporters complacent. Sanders likely to win Wyoming caucus but margin is narrower than I would have expected: https://t.co/KhpYSbHwvO Trump doing great in the Northeast is already priced into these projections, IOW. They also have him winning Indiana, which is questionable. Assuming Trump gets shut out in Colorado, he could win *every* delegate in New York and still project to just 1,199. https://t.co/onw531GsKx Even if Trump sweeps EVERYTHING through mid-May, including states where he's a big underdog, still vulnerable to a bad performance in CA. This is delusional on the part of Trump's campaign. Math doesn't work. https://t.co/prf6mezyAO https://t.co/GQJerEDx0C Snowpening Day. https://t.co/rLITSr3ZVn If Trump gets shut out in Colorado -- which seems possible -- he'd be down to 1,175 projected delegates. https://t.co/Vow3qe2vZn Taking a long weekend in Chicago, free from thinking about the campaign. Here's the view from outside my hotel. https://t.co/Kgwq7vDuvi Confessions of a degenerate 'American Idol' gambler, by @skepticalsports --&gt; https://t.co/xY8KybCKLr To be more precise, Trump's election day vote tends to match his polls. Other candidates (esp. Cruz) win undecideds &amp; gain relative to him. Oh great now Team Trump is all #skewedpolls. Funny thing is he's actually *underperformed* his polls so far.
https://t.co/RLaZ1JIOku Trump should be fine in the Northeast. Certainly in NY. Probably in PA/MD. But CA would make me nervous. https://t.co/lJgdEidvFW Meanwhile, Trump's actual vote share isn't growing much. https://t.co/lJgdEidvFW https://t.co/0dBorstt5m Big story being overlooked: Trump's now going to need 40%+ to win in most states. Mid-30s won't cut it. https://t.co/lJgdEidvFW This is good https://t.co/uY8YGKtG3o @jodyavirgan: tbh only stat that matters is Clutch Swipe Percentage (CSP), fraction of successful swipes with the train in the station. Also, too few Kasich at-large delegates (10) for him to have a full slate in WV. But Cruz (36) and Trump (31) arguably have too many. Republican voters in West Virginia will have to pick 22 at-large delegates from a list of 220. What could go wrong? https://t.co/qFgRk8DV5O @LPDonovan: Basically we don't know very much unless we have samples large enough to break out the ~10 extremely blue districts in/near NYC. @LPDonovan: It's a problem to lump NYC &amp; LI together. LI &amp; Staten Island will be great for Trump. Manhattan/Brooklyn/Bronx maybe not. The delegates mostly are not "the establishment". Instead, they're grassroots activists, local party leaders, etc. https://t.co/LcpRIPQzwZ Cruz is way more likely than Ryan or Kasich to emerge out of a contested convention. https://t.co/LcpRIPQzwZ RT @FiveThirtyEight: Ted Cruz, not Paul Ryan, would probably win a contested convention: https://t.co/ZiFcZllcte https://t.co/LyahTsEfTV PA polling looks like IL, not WI, with Trump in high (not mid) 30s and Cruz / Kasich splitting the balance evenly. https://t.co/3uhznpZAEE Though uncommitted, those PA delegates are elected on the ballot, so assumptions about delegates from other states may not hold up well. The 54 unbound delegates in PA are a wild card. Not many pro-Trump but many say will vote for state/district winner. https://t.co/zlwplj64yk Plurality favorite or majority favorite? Have to sleep on it. Good argument that markets underprice both Trump and Cruz vs. Ryan etc. (7/) Despite all that, Trump has various ways to win nomination with or without getting to 1237 by California. Still probably the favorite. (6/) Trump’s at 35% now in California, per our polling average. If that’s what he gets on June 7, no way he gets to 1237 delegates by then. (5/) That’s a big problem for Trump, especially given that Trump consistently performs mediocrely vs. his polls and wins few late-deciders. (4/) Some states are stronger or weaker for Trump -- NY will be good -- but overall he’s not gaining much as other candidates drop out. (3/) The big story is that Trump seems to have a -- let’s not call it a “ceiling” -- but certainly lots of upward resistance in his support. (2/) For those still awake: I think people are missing the forest for the trees a bit on Trump vs. Cruz. Mini-tweetstorm ahead. (1/) Weird mix of equal parts over-reaction *and* under-reaction in my Twitter feed. Let's take a breath and see how things look in a few days. OK, a few more thoughts about the Republican results tonight. https://t.co/xRNL4VtxVI Trump came close to his results in neighboring states tonight. Cruz had a breakthrough, though. https://t.co/Fr9OFsNZ0y American Research Group (ARG) poll off by a mere 31 percentage points on the GOP side so far. https://t.co/zpJw0RIt0Q A few weeks ago, we set Trump's over/under in Wisconsin at 25 delegates. Gonna be way short of that. https://t.co/fvJkS8qTpz Geographic splits in exit polls pretty good for Cruz. If right, Trump highly competitive in WI-7, others dicey. https://t.co/cXJqJuzUGy Combined pre-election + exit poll estimate would have Cruz winning WI by 8-9%. High margin of error though. https://t.co/bM6GBPHm0G Walker's the only Republican where you wonder if he dropped out too early. Everyone else just-in-time or too late. https://t.co/MsHZUFuRYf The NIH Claims Wisconsin Ranks Only 7th In Per-Capita Beer Consumption. Here's Why Those Stats May Be #Skewed. https://t.co/1tbNirmU98

I must rectify this. @yoavgo @cgeorgewilliams @haldaume3 Indeed. Looking forward to continuing it offline. Are you in London anytime soon? @yoavgo @cgeorgewilliams @haldaume3 Tweets are way too short to have this conversation. Or I need shorter words. @yoavgo @cgeorgewilliams @haldaume3 Learn. Regs like L1 penalty enforce sparsity, but is this enough to get a state transition matrix? @yoavgo @botminds @ogrisel @haldaume3 I also share the intuition but formal proof lacking. Just unlikely to learn structured sparse weights. @cgeorgewilliams @yoavgo @haldaume3 But since all finite langs are regular, this is a good Q. Do RNNs lack the necessary inductive biases? @cgeorgewilliams @yoavgo @haldaume3 Theoretically, no. There are plenty of infinite regular languages an RNN should be able to learn.

If tape is external and RNN weights model ops and state transitions, it's all discrete. @haldaume3 @yoavgo indeed @tristandeleu @yoavgo @haldaume3 That’s what I’d expect. @yoavgo @tallinzen @zehavoc @haldaume3 You need two stacks to copy, so perhaps it’s even at least recursively enumerable (TM required). @yoavgo @tallinzen @zehavoc @haldaume3 (Unbounded) copy is beyond context free.

S → a D b c C
D → a D b
D → ε
C → c
C → ε @yoavgo @haldaume3 eg. (ab)|(aabb)|...|(a^Nb^N)c+, which is infinite but regular. @yoavgo @haldaume3 pseudo CF @yoavgo @haldaume3 As you will know, a lot of reglangs "look" CF but are not, if bounds on length of pseudo CG segments. @yoavgo @haldaume3 Balanced parens with bounds on num of open parens is regular. Evidence of learning unbounded case? @yoavgo @haldaume3 Intresting. Can you give examples or details? @yoavgo @haldaume3 I'm interested in the broader topic of the limits of RNNs as well. We should talk :) @ogrisel @yoavgo @haldaume3 Not sure I understood that guy's comment or remember it well enough to follow up. Was there more to it? @ogrisel @yoavgo @haldaume3 They're not Turing complete anyway I think. A specific RNN size can express elems of a (finite?) set of TMs. @yoavgo @haldaume3 They lack inductive bias to learn small set of productions that generalise. @yoavgo @haldaume3 Little evidence that LSTMs can learn CFGs. They observe finite set of examples so regular language fits data. @yoavgo @haldaume3 Or at least struggle to learn LL where Ls are (matching) strings of a finite regular language. This lang is also regular. @yoavgo @haldaume3 LSTMs will struggle to learn \bigcup_{i=1}^N{a^ib^i} for non-trivial (but finite) N.

Until you start giving more of a crap about facts than rosy promises, your situation will not improve. Brexit *vote* deepens national debt by £58Bn, admits Government. The project is a failure before it even began. Madness to continue. Tories claimed Labour couldn't handle the economy because of £800Bn debt have now doubled it. Not a fan of labour, but what does that say? @keith_wilson Rents will stay about the same, so landlords get a better margin, renters see no difference, and agencies take a hit. (3/3) @keith_wilson Then landlords will want to shop around to increase profit margins, so agencies will lower fees to compete. (2/3) @keith_wilson Tenant fees will be passed to landlords who will raise rent, which market can support since tenants don't pay fees. (1/3) @keith_wilson Landlords will benefit. Tenants will see no change. Lettings agents will need to cut profit margins. #callingit @keith_wilson @timcrane102 More like prisoners' dilemma.

https://t.co/pC2591saU4 Nice post by @GaryMarcus on how NLU is next frontier for AI research. Music to my ears, of course. https://t.co/IR876SxzyY If anyone is counting, as of tonight I have been over 30 minutes delayed on 4/6 tube or commuter rail journeys this week. Peachy. @fchollet This is true, but on the flip side, privatising obviously wasn’t the solution either. @joanfihu @fchollet When I moved to London, would regularly take GWR to Oxford. Invariably delayed, perhaps 50% of the trips I took. @joanfihu @fchollet Disagree that trains are punctual in the UK. Anecdotal evidence, but e.g. have been on train 5x, this week, 3x delayed. @joanfihu @fchollet So Fr/Gb/Sp have late trains. At least in Fr/Sp the prices are lower, and don’t go to line rail operators’ pockets. @fchollet So whether the government operates the rail service or not, the government is still in the loop wrt. effecting change. @fchollet If I dislike a train operator, I really have no choice other than to petition the government to not renew the franchise. @fchollet Within the context of a service where there can be no free market and the state must act as a proxy for it, it seems reasonable. @samim Exactly. Commuters cannot, for the most part, “vote with their wallets”. All deals need to go through govt anyway, so why go private? Please, baby boomers et al. Please keep on telling us how British Rail was so much worse. Just like the housing market was amirite? Another day, another "signal failure" making me late.

Disagree with the way this is being stated by the Guardian article. @asayeed I take your point: it is not an ideal solution to the woes of the world. But is sometimes harmful philanthropy better than none? @asayeed I don't entirely disagree with that, but immediately poo-pooing any fairly radical reduction of wealth of this sort gets us nowhere @asayeed Nothing wrong with skepticism, but just the subtitle makes me rage.

Better presentation. Still same weird evaluation claims. Much less offensive title. @floridi Sorry Luciano, but this article demonstrates a lack of understanding of the DQN research. The proposed dichotomy is also weird. @carlyminsky no worries! @carlyminsky Hence my problem with the response, which doesn't preclude my dislike for the video is responds to. @carlyminsky Mockery is indeed unhelpful, I agree. But fat acceptance is on the other side of a false dichotomy. @carlyminsky Logical consistency doesn't negate the fact that P(unhealthy|fat) &gt;&gt; P(unhealthy|~fat). Is the focus not data-driven? @carlyminsky And heaven knows I should follow it more closely myself! @carlyminsky I don't see anything wrong with health authorities saying "watch your weight, eat healthy" (they do) as a general directive. @carlyminsky Not to be crude, but "fat -&gt; unhealthy" does not preclude "not fat ^  unhealthy".

This doesn't hold for Tree LSTMs -&gt; RNN LSTMs though, I believe. @yoavgo @richardsocher Well it's definitely the case that a left branching tree-RNN with constraints on the transform mats is an vanilla RNN @yoavgo @richardsocher … so maybe a weaker bias? @yoavgo @richardsocher Yes that's true, although that's how we receive information aurally, and when we read (or right-left) … @yoavgo @richardsocher One thing's for sure: just doing things sequentially makes scaling to entire docs easy. Cf. http://t.co/8oNMcfUsZD @yoavgo @richardsocher Tree-RNNs introduce a syntax-driven structural bias in the net. If the bias is correct, it can help. If not, then ??? @yoavgo @RichardSocher problem @yoavgo @RichardSocher Yes.

That's why we should try and solve problems with the most general approach possible. @zehavoc @dimazest @manaalfar Yes. You don't nesc. need SOTA, but experimental validation is needed in end-to-end tasks. @dimazest If linguistic theories yields no empirically verifiable improvements to predictive systems, why should we believe them? @manaalfar I think that's a very different sense of "philosophy", though. There is so much of a disconnect between philosophy of language and NLP. Should philosophers start going to ACL? Unions are probably still somewhat relevant, but it's time to get rid of tube drivers.

On an unrelated note, it's been too long, man. Just had Ian and Phil over in London. We miss you bro. @EconAndrew COMPUTERS. HOW DO THEY WORK? @EconAndrew the syntax for piping stderr is clunky and hard to remember. I always end up doing:
$ foo -h 2&gt; /tmp/bar; less /tmp/bar @EconAndrew Yes it does :) Also when you call help you typically intend to consume the output, so stdout seems like the right choice. Why do so many 3rd party command line tools write help/-h output to stderr rather than stdout? Makes it much harder to pipe to less.

I will be following this closely :-) St Andrews dev office asking for info l/news about me. Considering it a request for money (which I don't have). Sorry alma mater dearest... Nigel Crook recommends:
Good free stats textbook with R examples: http://www.math.umass.edu/~lavine/Book/book.html
Michael Lavine, you rock. I hate it how each time I tweet about NLP (Natural Language Processing) all these friggin' "life coaches" and idiots start following me. I think putting my head down and going through a solid stats textbook is going to be one of my new years resolutions... Diving back into Manning & Schütze's "Foundations of Statistical NLP". Good book, but I have a short attention span when it comes to stats. @whiteley I see we have similar tastes in scotch. Top man. :-) Departmental fame: http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/news/287-full.html Made it home to Paris. Now to do no work (except writing my IWCS talk) for two weeks. Is on the eurostar. Hell yeah. I'm at the end of a queue going ALL AROUND the outside of St Pancras, at 5am. Must be thousands here. Cold. Not amused. RT @WittTweets: Is it just me, or does everyone have a deep-seated need for someone they can just talk bloody nonsense to?  (1929, aged 40) @seamus_quigley most good science is about (or aided by) beer. RT @seamus_quigley: Why are scientists always experimenting with yeast? It's not because its genome is simple & similar to ours. It's be ... Wittgenstein's dream of clarity has been forgotten. Contemporary philosophers spend their time cramming the fly back into the fly-bottle. @profron More like: "Verbal and mathematical aptitude measures, by GRE scores? Physics rocks the house." :-P Off to Canterbury for the day with Jenn and Maria. Thinking about Wittgenstein on the bus. Need to re-read TLP and PI. Teaching done. Had lunch with Roger Penrose. On my way to Paris for the weekend. Life is good. RT @mfeathers: Hilarious rejection notices of the most important papers in CS: http://bit.ly/ekFfgS [PDF] Upcoming article in New Scientist about our work on quantum + categories + linguistics. Am psyched. Productive two days in Cambridge. Long bus ride to Oxford. Lots of work to do over next two weeks. ACL deadline. Eep. Off to Cambridge for two days of work with Stephen Clark and Merhnoosh Sadrzadeh. Hoping for a productive 48h to justify this early start...

#CoDiMo #Quantum #Categories #Linguistics @keith_wilson As far as I can tell, it all gets fed into the student loans which are pretty generous in this country. @carlbaker Everyone does, but the review was launched before the government changed, and presupposed no cuts. They are independent things. @carlbaker Yes, that's bad. However, the cuts have nothing to do with the Browne review. I oppose the cuts, not so sure I oppose the review. @keith_wilson Industry and society already fund educational institutions through existing taxes. @keith_wilson Yeah. It's passing on the cost to those benefiting most directly from the education. Am I the only person who finds the Browne review completely sensible? It's the cuts that will spell the end of British academia, not fees... Just had a fantastic outing in Abingdon. Love rowing again. Let's see  how long this feeling lasts. @consequently Isn't that what graduate students are for? :-) Working hard to get some stuff ready for #ACL2011. Wishing we had some good programmers in addition all the good theory people in the group. Psyched that people like @earnmyturns and @dwiddows think that our group's research on categorical compositional DSMs is pretty and cool :-) RT @earnmyturns: Working hard on getting to the bottom of http://goo.gl/da5zL Have a hunch that it's useful as well as pretty @NoahSilverstein do you have a recording of this bad boy? Anyone know a good way of efficiently sharing string-&gt;string maps between python and java? No one should have to row the day after a rowing dinner. Everything hurts. RT @PayPalUK: iPad draw is tomorrow! Win 2 iPads, 1 for following our £40k ad characters, 1 for re-tweeting this http://bit.ly/aGxSIH RT @SDMumford: Did I hear the maths right? UK cutting £4.2 billion from education budget but spending £5 billion on two new aircraft car ... @olehjortland I think it's fair. Not enough work on category theory in phil of math. Off to do the last sit-down exam of my life. Going to the opening of Oxford's new school of government. God knows why I was invited, but free food is free food. I &lt;3 my new iPhone 4 :-) Slowly realising that I actually need to read up on efficient DSM implementation if we're gonna get vectors from 6M sentences for #CoDiMo... Presentation of quantum-inspired categorical #CoDiMo went well. Some great questions. People seemed to like it :-) #esslli2010 Finished implementing vector builder for #CoDiMo. Takes a bloody long time to run on big corpora. Fortunately only needs to be done once... @tom_harper Copenhagen :-) I am chewing on salty licorice gum. I am never leaving this place. Evol. Ling. course is over. I'm sold on the embodiment requirement for developing semantics. How would I apply it to my work? #esslli2010 Last day of the first week of #esslli2010 courses. Looking forward to the party tonight and a weekend of cooldown time. @tom_harper Talk is more about learnability. The claim seems to be more that there is good evidence showing that NL are tractably learnable. @tom_harper I kinda agree on the Chomsky front. I thought they were too. This dude has some convincing examples though, as far as I can tell Lappin suggests that the class of natural languages may plausibly not be in the Chomsky hierarchy. #esslli2010 Listening to Shalom Lappin (KCL) present developments in language learning providing opposition to poverty of stimulus arguments #esslli2010 Wrote the first module of #CoDiMo afternoon this afternoon: Dependency Analyser. All in a single glorious 668 char line of awk+sed+grep+C&C. Proof theory course covering relation between categories and proofs. Fun times. #esslli2010 @olehjortland The #esslli2010 proof theory course is being taught by Lutz Strassburger from Ecole Polytechnique, Paris. @consequently Incidentally I was *just* talking about the work you did with Beal while commenting upon Dov Gabbay's #esslli2010 keynote. @consequently Yes! Course notes for all the courses are available at http://phis.ruc.dk/ESSLLI2010_Course_Material.zip Evolutionary Linguistics dealing with compositional semantics today. God, I wish I had a knocked back a red bull this morning. #esslli2010 Slept a good8h. Still super tired. 6h+ of lectures per day sure takes its toll. How did I survive high school? #esslli2010 Ah, finally we get to log-linear regression. I could have gone to some other course for the first few days. :-P #esslli2010 Stats lecturer is explaining natural logs. WTF... I guess the linguists might not know this stuff. #esslli2010 Re: Proof nets --- Anything that simplifies proofs is a good addition to formal logic, in my book... Me likey. #esslli2010 Proof nets in Proof Theory course look a lot like categorical graphical calculi. Time to pay attention :-) #esslli2010 Kind of tempted to have a look at Dov Gabbay's book on the stuff he talked about last night: http://bit.ly/cj4efH #esslli2010 More Wittgenstein refs in Evolutionary Linguistics course. Yum. #esslli2010 Listening to Dov Gabbay (KCL) talking about unifying different forms of reasoning  under a meta-framework. Interesting. #esslli2010 Found a way to do simple textual entailment with our categorical framework today. Very exciting... #CoDiMo RT @jnwhiteh: Pure amazing: http://bit.ly/8XE7K7 #fb @keith_wilson Tell that to metaphysicians. They spend most  of their time adding a few layers. Proof theory course is good fun. Connection between logic and categories coming up. The gospel of Lord MacLane... #esslli2010 OTOH, Evo. Ling. course recognises the importance of embodiment and action for linguistic development. #esslli2010 #wittgenstein Evolutionary linguistics course sees developing a language as pairing references and properties with new tokens. Disappointing. #esslli2010 Day 2 of #esslli2010. Should have slept more. Considering some course changes. Game time... The class on semantic roles feels more like a debate between linguists than a class. Interesting nonetheless... #esslli2010 Drooling over some people's mad beamer/LaTeX skillz. Might need to make my slides a little more sexy... #esslli2010 As predicted, a lot of the category theory course is stuff I know quite well. Next few days might get more technical. #esslli2010 Being cheeky by attending the category theory course at #esslli2010 as a refresher before writing my transfer report. So far, nothing new. RT @jnwhiteh: I'll be watching to see how this pans out, for sure: http://bit.ly/cogqCo P is not equal to NP: a proof? http://rjlipton.wordpress.com/ Conceptual Spaces and Semantic Maps: so far, I don't really buy it. Seems like there's some circularity in the methodology. #esslli2010 Evolutionary Linguistics: nice Wittgensteinian approach to non-truth theoretic semantics; cool demos from Sony France. #esslli2010 First day of #esslli2010. Following the "Evolutionary Linguistics" and "Conceptual Spaces and Semantic Maps" courses this morning. RT @danieldekok: Very nice ESSLLI 2010 summer school goodies, including a waterproof Crumpler laptop bag. #esslli2010 Made it to Copenhagen, registered for the summer school. Weather is super lame. #esslli2010 Jetting off to Copenhagen to speak at (and attend the rest of) #esslli2010 Writing my ESSLLI talk. http://tinyurl.com/34bw46m Leaving Miami for Pittsburgh. Hope it'll be a little less muggy. Into the eurotunnel go I. Bye bye, data connection. On Eurostar, heading back to Oxford. Getting a bit tired of these super short trips interrupting my workflow. Need rest. Off to Paris until Tuesday for parents' wedding anniversary. RT @darthvader: Just made the dude who invented the vuvuzela my new evil apprentice. @tom_harper What was the interview for? Back in Oxford. Flying back to the UK today. Gooodbye beautiful Californian weather... You will be missed! RT @Bauart: Bill Gates tried leaving his new Microsoft "Kin" phone at a bar...

It's still there. RT @libdems: You must register to vote by tomorrow. This means you must fill out and sign a form today. You can do it easily online: htt ... @PeterSmith Detexify is cool but a little slow; I still find it faster to look through pp62-69 of "The Not So Short Introduction to LaTeX". Can't decide if I'm tired of Twitter or not. It seems so redundant now FB incorporates similar functionality and better privacy control. Six weeks until Summer Eights! Gotta get training. Gym time! http://bit.ly/d56glS "Logic is not, of course, a STEM subject"... I hope Simon Blackburn is being sarcastic here... Damn tabs... @keith_wilson that's jolly good news! :-) Off to NI for a few days. Term's over. No more marking, practicals, lectures, college business, interviews, etc. Time to do research! :-) @tom_harper Good luck with the transfer viva! Rowing on for Balliol M4 at 4pm. Come on lads! Marking all day. Temptation to jump out window... rising. @carlbaker Are there any moral facts? I, for one, am getting pretty sick of snowy/rainy/wintery weather. Back from Berlin, dinner with three ambassadors, and talking nonsense to 80 Balliol old members. Good times. Off to Berlin for a few days with some college officials. Be back on Saturday. @whiteley A 16yo who can't *subtract*?That's... slightly depressing. Using my monitor vertically at work now. It makes reading papers and browsing articles at lot more pleasant...  http://twitpic.com/13r4g2 @carlbaker I think the comic makes it clear that the relation is one of analogy rather than equivalence, hence the distinction is preserved. @tom_harper It feels done, but it doesn't feel well. People should not have to wake up so early... In office by 9am, thanks to fire alarm drill waking me up at %&£# o'clock. Time for a bit of Turney/Montague/Lambek... which one to start with... Spent all day marking and doing coursework. Research time again tomorrow... Most of morning spent doing laundry and reading Wilks on Montague v. Wittgenstein. The laundry part sucked. At office, going over quantum computing notes for a little before doing some more reading on Montague semantics. RIP Salinger. You crazy bastard... @JamieFrost That too. I actually really like the #iPad. Guess where the salary from my IR marking is going? :-) @applebed That *is*, in fact, how I roll... @thomas_hodgson I'll have to take a look. It's not in our college library or the comlab stacks. Gonna have to hit the phil library. Blargh. I really wish there was a more concise introduction to Montague semantic than Dowty et al's. @JamieFrost Baggsy your office if it does! :-) Thinking of hitting ESSLLI this year: http://esslli2010cph.info/
Interesting workshop on distributional models of meaning. Done dealing with email and admin. Time to write some research notes before dropping in on Andreas' quantum compsci lectures... :-) Ed's work for the day: writing up the activity page for his DPhil research group. Time for coffee...
http://bit.ly/4tEZcj @tom_harper Surely you mean it's very cool *because* it involves Quantum Computing! :-) Great interview on quantum computing with Quantum Group's very own J. Biamonte: http://bit.ly/66uQ9I @jnwhiteh sorry I couldn't make it today! Today: reading stats stuff. I have a feeling it'll come in handy for CLG meetings. Back to the office tomorrow. WOot. @thomas_hodgson Those fortunately have nothing to do with my work, but it is annoying how the word quantum is being used by idiots. @thomas_hodgson It's an possibly unfortunate name for the stuff I'm working on for my DPhil. Enough semantic web and quantum linguistics reading yesterday. More on Montague semantics today. Reading up on semantic web. I can see the appeal... Finishing reading some papers. Pondering whether to spend afternoon reading in office or in manor. Have ignored twitter for 2+ weeks. Wow. Back in Oxford and busy (proof-)reading project papers. Good times... Back to Oxford today. Back to work tomorrow. Happy New Year, people! May your hangovers be less unpleasant than mine (I presume you had the good sense not to mix cheap gin and vodka). I hope today's event will encourage world govts to put pressure on China/US to reconsider their medieval attitude towards the death penalty. Made it home. Woohoo :-) WHO THE HELL DOESN'T SNOWPROOF THEIR GODDAMN TRAINS??! @sgpulman Unfortunately there were Eurostar problems. Hopefully will be flying back today, at a much higher cost. C'est la vie... New personal best: 69 (Outback) on #flightcontrol - New Level: Cabin Crew, http://cloudcell.com/r.php?g=2&m=231019&l=3 Google Chrome for Mac: so far, so good. Snappy response and clean interface. Me likey. Yet another day where administrative stuff and coursework get in the way of reading. @keith_wilson Tell me one of the said responses is simply "It's not very good". It pains me that qualia is still an object of discussion. It may be hard to wreck a nice beach, but image recognition is definitely harder... Screw decidability proofs, I'm reading computational linguistics papers... Have read #Logicomix. Verdict: anything that shows how cool foundations of mathematics is to the general public must rock. Ergo this rocks. Listening to Lauridsen's O Magnum Mysterium and trying to get to bed after a bit of Salinger. 8th week will not get me down... A break from life: very much needed right now. Bummed out by cancelled race today. On the plus side, this means I have time to read some papers for CLG meeting (which look fun this week). Last outing before ChCh today. Hope it isn't cancelled. Hope my supervisors don't hate me for doing no work this week because of rowing. :-/ @olehjortland You're in Oxford and haven't gotten in touch for a drink? Fail... :-) Two rowing outings this morning in the cold and rain. I can't believe I agreed to do this. Life will be rosier after ChCh regatta is over. Balliol MNA defeats St Anne's MN? by a length. Kickass. Next race coming up fast... Red Boat (Balliol MTA) defeats St Johns MTA. Woohoo. On to the next race! @jnwhiteh That sucks. Our WNA cox had to be replaced too, and she was really bummed out. Oh well... there's always Christ Church Regatta! Rowing at Nephthys regatta with Balliol MNA today. We missed first place by 2 seconds at Nephthys head. Today, we rectify that mistake! :-) Have to be up at 5.20am tomorrow for rowing. Part of me actually wants the river to be closed... Reading moral philosophy DPhil writing samples. There's 99 things actually related to my research I should be doing. But I'm not. Definitely feeling the physical impact of prepping for the regattas. So tired, I should have gone to bed at least an hour ago. Stupid me... Pain everywhere this morning. Pre-regatta rowing practice taking its toll. On the plus side, I can feel my posture has improved a lot. Hungover. Woke up early this morning for swim test for ChCh regatta. Swim test is on Monday. FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFU- Listening to supervisor on BBC Radio 4. Categories, linear logic, Lambek calc, Montague semantics and some TM proofs. Am I realistically expected to learn java alongside all this? @thomas_hodgson Sent the paper to your gmail address. Enjoy! CompSci peeps, any thoughts about Google's new Go language? http://golang.org/
Google seems to be clamping down on python use internally :-( @jnwhiteh Sorry! Did not feel well enough to come into the office today... Ah the glory of tea: http://bit.ly/DHHK6 Mid-week crew dates are a bad idea. Getting pennied while drink cheap wine never ends well :/ WTF is up with certain famous philosophers these days? Have they forgotten how to be decent human beings? @PiaWojtinnek, is sending our supervisor to a bar that's "a bit rough after midnight" really a good idea? :-) Back to work on natural language semantics. Montague, Montague, wherefore art thou Montague... I had weird dreams last night about administrators misspelling my surname. I'm not sure how to interpret this... More and more philosophers are following me on Twitter. I was unaware I had anything interesting to say... :-/ Circuits then exchange dinner with Queens College. Healthy times... I would love it if my DPhil work wasn't constantly interrupted by classes and pb sheets. I did the friggin' MSc, people! Isn't that enough?? Starting to feel alive again after the last two weeks. My friends rock... @gunnerkrigg, you should check out the (free) steampunk expo in Oxford: http://tinyurl.com/orbyyf The style reminds me of your comic. No love from All Souls. Lots from Balliol :-) Win-win I guess...

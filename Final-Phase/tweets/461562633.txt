When thinking about how Hospcotch should look and feel we test w/ variety of kids to see how they respond #elemcode A3: It's crucial to actively reach out ‚Äî can't wait for people to come to you. Need to invite and show that everyone is welcome #elemcode @Catherine_D2013 Totes‚Äîcoding is a powerful form of creative expression. #elemcode @SKolhatkar But also, how do you get them in the door in the first place? Any tips? #elemcode @SKolhatkar Yes! Help Ss create something personally meaningful to *them* #elemcode A3: For example, projects we feature are girly, sporty, mathy, poetic. Show that coding can be used for many purpsoes, by many ppl #elemcode A3: Elevate examples of awesomeness that represent the community you seek to build #elemcode Q3: What tactics have you found that interest more girls/individuals underrepresented in tech to your coding programs?  #elemcode #csk8 @mrterborg @lekadegroot @jeannereed1 We see that the younger kids discover that they can be a great coder, more they stick w/ it #elemcode @Catherine_D2013 @lekadegroot @jeannereed1 Building strong foundation at young age means incorp. "coder" into identity - it lasts #elemcode @SKolhatkar Welcome! We're talking about challenges when trying to make your CS class more inclusive #elemcode @Ajay460 @lekadegroot @jeannereed1 Seeing examples of women doing the things you want to do is hugely encouraging #elemcode @Ajay460 By opening up activity, allow each child to interpret according to their interests! Esp if processes in place to support #elemecode Yes! Core activities should be delivered, well, when kids are in school! Hard when have to opt in. https://t.co/6ji1nHNUP3 @lekadegroot @jeannereed1 One reason I've seen is that it is presented as an isolated activity‚Äînot something you do w/ and to help others A2: Narrowly targeting content be isolating. More open ended and open to creativity=more kids will identify with it &amp; get excited #elemcode @AprilWathen Yes! Best way to see what works is by just doing it and learning from experience #elemcode @Catherine_D2013 @jeannereed1 @VisionsByVicky Yes! Seeing what others have made and learning from it is key :) Q2: What mistakes have you made trying to diversify coding programs (if you've tried!)? What should we learn from them?  #elemcode #csk8 @Kaitlyn_Fargo Welcome! @jeannereed1 It's hard to choose one theme that is  appealing to everyone‚Äîwe constantly are reevaluating content to test appeal #elemcode @lekadegroot Thanks for sharing! #elemcode @VisionsByVicky I'm sure you've helped make it that way! How? #elemcode @JayGreenlinger Totally! It needs to be a conscious effort. @AprilWathen Fantastic!

Does club resemble the class? @Catherine_D2013 @jeannereed1 @BitmojiApp Yesssssss! @jeannereed1 Interesting! why do you think more girls signed up initially? any idea on why they dropped off? @VisionsByVicky Amazing! And do you see any nuance in participation or enthusiasm among different groups? All equally engaged? @AprilWathen Hehe -- 1st time twitter chat moderator learning the ropes!

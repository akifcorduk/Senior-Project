@Andiznit On HBO yes. In theaters no. Baywatch will bomb for same reason Power Rangers did. Something from 90's people are embarrassed they watched.

Want to make a transforming shopping cart for old people. @RoyEltham Only played about 5 hours. Seems fun so far. Very Far Cry like. Time to play some more Ginger Evangeline Lily Shoot Metal Animals. @tenpencearcade @thebenheckshow @theHeckwKaren That is a thought with this year's projects, yes. Glad new MST3K host has a 2 syllable name. Always bugged me in original song where they stretched out "Jo-el" to fit two notes. #joelIsBest Since Disney going to live-action remake all of their films now how about getting James Cameron to actually film Little Mermaid underwater? @f5kn To a point. But it seems like only Disney is making money these days. @deliciousgames I've been there. Majority of movie going public hasn't and can't. Right now any modern LCD (let alone OLED) kicks theater's butt. They'd better innovate quick or gonna die for same reasons arcades did. @codemonkey0 The extruder is very inconsistent. @KevanTice USBC supports that but would be a pricey upgrade.

I have a sinking feeling Packers aren't going to make it to the "NFC VS Patriots-Bowl" (new name I came up with) @jryanthornburg Certainly. If you asked someone in the 80s to name a "super rich person" they probably would have said Trump. @makenai @theHeckwKaren Saw it on Prime Pantry and thought why not. Sometimes we make Tang screwdrivers. @PrioHuq See it writes itself!

Wake up Packers! For crying out loud. @turbolars Ah, Gamecube, back when Nintendo bothered to make good hardware. @KingOfHeart13 It's rumored to have similar specs to Nvidia Shield.

Start it at work so food is ready at 6? Before anyone thinks "Sang Last Christmas and then died on Xmas? How IRONIC!" Nope. Coincidence. #georgemichael OK. A search for "putty" on a 65-year-old woman's Chromebook... Yields the same thing. https://t.co/SwF7E1uE6P @mitchbear Or a butcher and artist search "render"? @tigheklory Yeah its weird. I should try it on my mom's chromebook at Xmas aka "the rare Ben sighting" How much does Google profile? If a programmer and a carpenter both search "putty" would they get different results? #parentsComputerTest @blindbunny My true form! @ILpinballclub Evil twins have goatees not beards!

Documenting the process as a show episode. Stay tuned! @BlockBuilder57 East side of Madison. "It's time to listen to Meatloaf and design pinball machines. And I'm not even out of gum!" @GoodTofuFriday I'm sure we could find a NOS replacement. Just need more time with the unit. @Burnout_23 We're thinking about seeing if we can borrow it for a month or two next year to do a deep dive on the system. @lazygamereviews 1st time I saw an 8" floppy as a kid (in a junk pile) I thought a 5.25" had been left out in the rain and swelled up :) @lazygamereviews Again it was great meeting you! Let me know if you ever need help with any retro PC projects! An early Thanksgiving dish! Our Portland Retro Gaming Expo episode is now live! https://t.co/UAhDV9X6y6 Nom nom nom gaming fun! @codemonkey0 That's the great thing with electronics. Even bad results are good ones. Yes! They brought back real Diet Pepsi with that chemical nobody actually cares about because it's in Diet Coke too! https://t.co/zVU5j8BZ9H @Callum_Barton_ Not sure that  counts but yes, better than any game movie. Including Tron. @brian_con Exactly. @lazygamereviews @brodycas3 @YouTube Tweetsourcing I love it! @brodycas3 Lazy Game Reviews would be the one to ask @lazygamereviews @Mike_IronFist I don't think superhero movies have much gas left in the tank. People want something new. @NebulaCustom XB1 takes 12v from PSU and knocks it down to various voltages. USB rail gives you 500mA per port. @NebulaCustom USB port good place to start. Videogame movies continue to get made despite near-zero success. Imagine the deluge should one finally hit? Replace comic movies maybe? @HeyItzJones Yeah was shocked how crummy that part of the design was. Strange for Nintendo. Working on "Next Heck Pinball" today here's an exclusive first look! :) https://t.co/hp7pH652zQ @HeyItzJones We put all our project filed for download on the element14 community. @Superjustinbros What if there was a kit to build one? Our Portland episode https://t.co/wGtPLXJlRl features @lazygamereviews @MetalJesusRocks @PatTheNESpunk the Sony-SNES prototype and more! @makenai I've heard it pronounced every way one could imagine. We, as a nation, need to put aside our differences, together as one people... and decide how the hell you're supposed to pronounce "Wacom" @hughker @newglarusbeer Yum! Having serious issues with input lag on #Battlefield1 PC. Lagging triggers, rubber-banding, even the reload key. Anyone else? Any fixes? Single handed controllers back on sale https://t.co/zKxq7ApfwZ Click here for more details, thanks! @tigheklory @TheJonesCode Yeah it was a bit dark in 3D as well. @richthofen Yes. He had good ideas just didn't practice what he preached. @dmr_87 I'm not really interested in it to be honest. @richthofen Foam core and hot glue all the way! Here I go again... https://t.co/NJi2rPfoPA Very close to taking orders again for Single Handed XB1 controllers. Thanks for everyone's patience as we work to make them better! @esp0ntaneo @lazygamereviews I've heard #Gearbox are pinball fans. Maybe it could work! Finishing up our Portland show.

NuTrek films stuck in the same mold at late 90's Next Gen just done splashier. @codemonkey0 In an extreme pinch it can double as a 1901 Sears catalog. @codemonkey0 Blue colored?

Stayed home today feeling a bit ill. Let's coin a term for "catching a bug at conventions" seems to be a thing. @tomsliwowski People would be much better off with a gantry system.

Haven't hooked it up yet. Probably later today. Design is fine I like the off-color plastic :) @TheSpencerGreen It won't have much in it so I won't bother. Picked up one of these at Portland Retro Gaming Expo https://t.co/qqmHYWTTOK Excited to give it a try! "I want to keep my iPhone safe in a case, but I also want people to know I own an iPhone. I'm glad they make cases with holes in the back!" Pinball talk went well. Had to compete with the Angry Video Game Nerd's line though. That line was off the hook! @Hopelessforevr @PatTheNESpunk It's the ultimate coffee table book for game geeks. PBR on tap? Pinball in any random bar? Hashtag #portland https://t.co/QCSSJKemJ2 @PatTheNESpunk I promise I'll learn to read soon :) Ground Kontrol has some cool neon.

Any YouTubers at Portland Retro expo want to trade interviews? I promise to ask only strange questions! @thebenheckshow Here we go... https://t.co/amWSuREJrH Now in Portland. We still have five axels and 3678 lbs of bear meat to spare. https://t.co/FlDMCTWQTb Arrived in Portland. Have never been here before. Looking forward to the Expo! @firsthour I guess technically float on air? Hey I just realized we're on The Oregon Trail! Hope Max doesn't get dysentery, I forgot to buy extra bacon and wagon grease. @FelixK_15 I have two complete drives, one sub assembly and two lenses to try and make it work. Hope that's overkill enough. On our way to Portland Retro Gaming Expo. Bringing parts to hopefully get PS1\SNES CD-ROM working. @Sonikku_a It HAS to have a touchscreen. Since it's no longer "pocketable" not replacing your tablet would be a critical error. @sonikokaruto Hahaha. If Zapruder footage had been analyzed to the extent of your average video game trailer JFK's murder would have been solved in about an hour. @f5kn 3 batteries, Tegra-style ARM, possibly a co-GPU on the base station like Surface Book. @theDunson @AliExpress_EN Well, better than ending up in a political ad I guess. @PortablesofDoom @theHeckwKaren I think the name is fine. It tells you exactly what it does. #switch My take: Because of its size, needs to replace a tablet's functionality as well. $299 SKU probably doesn't include dock. Asked our resident Nintendo lover @theHeckwKaren her thoughts on #Switch "That's cool! I would buy one!" @pinballkeefer Keith Johnson video mode! Great meeting you! @hushdrops @C2CPinball Haha well played. @C2CPinball Were you here Nate? @tigheklory Paxton wasn't in that movie. @MaskedGEEK_YT It involves the first and second movies.

In downtown Chicago today touring some places. https://t.co/9RU5pfsq1Y @tigheklory @LnghrnEngineer @techillusions Don't need all that nonsense. Just a traditional style game that costs less than a car. @tigheklory @LnghrnEngineer @techillusions Big LCD, haptic feedback on cabinet, head tracking to simulate perspective. @LnghrnEngineer @tigheklory @techillusions You could use all top shelf equipment and still be leagues below what a new pin costs. @swiftswindler Lion King = Hamlet with lions @JupiterRomulus That didn't hurt Hellboy. When it comes to story, easiest way to fix something is to cut it. Kind of like Civil War surgery. @PrioHuq Which one? Titan AE? @PrioHuq Haha good point. Titan AE also started as live-action. Why remake #LionKing ? Why not Atlantis, a movie that had potential despite many issues and should have been live action to begin with? @LnghrnEngineer How many computers can you build with that? @LnghrnEngineer @tigheklory @jeriellsworth @techillusions No. Track the eyes, nose, mouth and change table perspective via those cues. @tigheklory @jeriellsworth @techillusions AR pinball with head tracking and virtual gameplay would make all other games obsolete instantly. @LnghrnEngineer @tigheklory Yeah that's dumb. Would require FAR more power than the prototype we did. Helping @TheBodgery weld their pedal car for #makerfairemke. Not much of the original car is left. Hope it holds. https://t.co/2UuzQ2LDGc @colonelwheel Cool! Good luck! @colonelwheel @DarHodg Goto https://t.co/m7XwqM70pL and there's a link to email me.

Probably a gimmick until someone gets it right at which point it will be amazing. (like 3D printers) @theHeckwKaren My mom could totally take your mom. But we'd need to check if our grandmas have different names... @cardboardteck Yeah I've seen it at many Maker Faires. Pretty cute. You ever put electronics in them? Finally going to watch Captain America Civil War tonight. Hopefully everyone's mothers have different names else will be a boring battle. AMH Pinball version 23 now available. Biggest update yet! Free DLC! https://t.co/XyXQfpG24y @joystiq Best article I've seen yet on the subject. @stuffwhy Usually have to add extraneous rings to "reconnect" the shapes, then you can proceed with intersecting them. @aurich I miss the days of "buy Creative Suite once, update every 3 years for $600 and nothing changes during that time" For 3x the cost Adobe used to be, and with 25 years of updates, I shouldn't have to "trick" Pathfinder into working. https://t.co/UHG5UHGlxm @TheNoSignal Yes. But your skill should allow you to win, not how many anti tank bombs you spawn with. Titanfall did that balance best. @x @PinballWomenOtt The ghost-related pinball machine market is more crowded now so I have to work harder :) @PinballWomenOtt Yes for some reason I spent hundreds of hours this summer updating a game that sold out over a year ago. @MrXBob I used to do that with PS3-X360 controllers. Super tedious. I raised the price and people kept asking. Bizarre. #bf1beta Sorry teammates, but I can't *not* call that one tank "the Indiana Jones tank". Also, nerf the tanks. They've been OP since BF3. @edrobertson @DaWezl @getbarenaked @fmrewind Still have your AMH? Big update coming soon! @MrXBob No they're all chipped to be console specific. Is open beat of #battlefield1 worth checking out? Do the horses have armor? Is it a sniper-fest? @Lev_Saunders Harp-ception @kiddy_link No (good) reason for carts. The "what if you don't have internet" argument is bunk look at all these kids with tablets! @seven5three No, they're just going to put the final nail in the Nintendo 3rd party coffin. Their company is DRUNK on hardware. NX using carts is all about 1) revenue stream from cart manufacture and 2) giving retailers more to sell Remember how all licensed NES-SNES-64 carts were identical? That's because Nintendo controlled and manufactured them all. @Grindlethorpe Well, you'll have to wait as I honestly have no interest in tearing PS4 Slim down. Wasn't it slim enough to start? @bjcmartin2013 You mean like these? https://t.co/jTgBqRiDtZ @tigheklory "Building this tiny home will save the planet!".... and if it's under 250 sq ft we don't need a building permit #realReasons @mahmoudtaji Your Netflix has *less* selection? How is that possible? It doesn't have 200 cooking shows to choose from? @tigheklory They just build "fun" vanity houses for families (because no family would ever actually *use* one) Kind of pointless. @Arthrimus This week.

Re-watched Galaxy Quest last week (one of the best Star Trek films ironically) and realized it's basically the same movie as A Bug's Life. The Thing remake doesn't transition from Universal globe down to Antarctica? Insta-fail. @Kandy_Man_1990 @nvidiashield Easier for them to say "build us a tablet" then connect a controller than make a custom device like original. @Kandy_Man_1990 It's a tablet now. https://t.co/PIkmZ5Cyhf @Kandy_Man_1990 You've just described the Nvidia Shield. @adi_miller ZX tape loader is a phone app that you should look at. There's also programs for computers to emulate tape. Haven't tweeted in a while as I'm not sure how to express my true feelings on the PS4K Neo. @TVMiller Cool! @Andrelljackson1 Get some grip tape. It's like electric tape sandpaper. Sporting goods stores should have it. @jimleinen I'm not really interested in that thing. I have a working NES. @FanManChill Watched it on a plane without my noise-cancelling headphones. Maybe I'd have liked it more had I heard more dialog?

Any boom boxes I can find will be a bonus! @GoodTofuFriday No worries! Maybe somebody has a matching boom box they can donate. I also ordered a few mechs off eBay. @GoodTofuFriday CD assembly is KSM-360AAm, the pickup itself is KSS-360A. The later of which I found a few on eBay. PlayStation Prototype seems to use same drive mech as early 90's Sony CFD-250/260 boom box. Anyone have donor parts? https://t.co/vYzrhFQYd9 @tigheklory WiiU could at least get the PS3/360 PPC port table scraps.

Called it. https://t.co/wj6JNOFnJS @SphieChan Thanks! The more info we have, the better. @SphieChan My contact info is on https://t.co/m7XwqM70pL if you could email them to me? Sounds like we may do a follow-up repair! @SphieChan I did see a notice in the menu that it's a double speed drive. Think that will make a difference? @SphieChan There are 3 pots on the driver board. @terry51d @AlphaOmegaSin @GameOnExpo @ReplayFX Looks like a match. I'd suggest buying 2+ just in case / as a backup. @terry51d @AlphaOmegaSin @GameOnExpo @ReplayFX Terry check my email and tweets a Twitter user has found a possible replacement lens! @SphieChan found this: https://t.co/QRxP7QzRpz and check out these comparisons!

Maybe in time for Christmas? @samred @arstechnica I posted it to my main Twitter. I have faith The Interwebs can find a compatible drive/lens. Maybe @lazygamereviews ? https://t.co/Xqq8OseBt7 Hi-res photos of PlayStation Prototype's CD-ROM drive.

Couldn't see any light from the lens. @tigheklory @TheJonesCode Was Bones allowed to be a character? Major flaw in last two films. @tigheklory @TheJonesCode Good to hear! @digiwombat Haha, there are a lot of episodes to watch! @blazingskies You're welcome! Adobe Premiere must analyze your project &amp; mathematically decide the most annoying track to randomly plop a copy-pasted clip into. @JoelGHodgson @RaymeCVinson @netflix That's great news, it means they'll finally be some movies on the service :) @DirtyLanni It has to do with the system's lock out chip, which can be disabled. Plenty of tutorials for that online! @TimothySCarter Don't like how I can open a Premiere project from 3 days ago and be told "must be converted to latest version" @sachz @kobunheat @SeattleRetro @YouTube Yeah but it didn't read an audio disc. Laser itself may be dead. FFS! Adobe update wrecks my desktop links, and also removes my AI templates? #1 rule of software = DON'T WASTE MY TIME! @Techblogogy Which one doesn't have serial? @MetalJesusRocks @ColdMoon55 Guessing there's no US media to test on it then? @LnghrnEngineer You are obsessed with USB C! @Lunnaku Me too. The homebrew guy Matt is going to burn them a disc. If the CD laser has died maybe the community can find a replacement? @Josh_Grid21 Can't rename items in Quick Access. Devices &amp; Printers buried in menus. Modern Apps mostly useless. "It's the Final Countdown!"...

It's tough competing with all the "unboxing crap &amp; swear about video games" channels. @LuigiBlood @Dieboldly With the bodge in place the CD-ROM did nothing. We tested it both ways. I left the wire in should they need to revert @kris_stoker No the pens don't last long at all in storage. So it you're going to use one, use it all at once. Sony Nintendo Playstation part 2 today! We examine the unit and try to fix it. But do we succeed? @kris_stoker Not sure. A few pieces of papers worth? Never really used the stuff. Dries up too quick. @LnghrnEngineer @TheJonesCode Star Trek Rises: Dawn of the Darkness Origins Retribution. @TheJonesCode Maybe that's the next podcast episode. We argue about Into Darkness the entire episode. @tigheklory Does it have more than 1 port on it? Hopefully for Star Trek Beyond, 93% on Rotten Tomatoes, but then I look and see the inexcusably awful "Into Darkness" was 86%. Hm..... @House_Alfieri No it isn't. We've just been buried in work. I mentioned it to Felix. OK, looks like I can make it to #MakerFaireDetroit next week! No booth, just a rando walking around #carKnowing @theHeckwKaren OK i just checked. 4 bags. But not collectible AT ALL! #bagFail #chexKnowing Prime Pantry box ordered! I can slice up all the cardboard in the box, stick it in my laser, and build more mockups for a movie idea. @b11_dr Everybody fails, we just edit them out! Haha! Take things slower, test more often, read datasheets carefully. 8 Star Wars films so far, 6 of which include Death Stars. Cool new BB8 though... Who looks like a Death Star. #enoughDeathStarsAlready @KDStudios Thanks for watching! @CromulentOne You have to sandblast them first right? @tigheklory That's a separate list for me. 1) do voice for animated movie 2) goto space 3) be in a country music band... Batting 0 on those. Learning to weld. Been on my to-do list for about 20 years. Pretty fun! Need to find more scrap for practice. https://t.co/LMjUFZ8Dp6 @f5kn People have already made homebrew games for an emulated version. So maybe the system will boot a burned disc? Sony-Nintendo-Playstation teardown here: https://t.co/QuKzdtnbPh But can we get it working again? Stay tuned for Part 2! @RetroSwimAU Much like that weird 4th disc that came in my Indiana Jones Blu-Ray set I'd imagine? Amazon Prime Day = the Garage Sale of the internet. You can tell by the uselessness of items, such as House of Cards Blu-Ray. @TRAK_BALLer It is surely one of the top 2 best ghost-hunting themed pinball machines available :) @LnghrnEngineer Cant stand the heat? Then get out the Wild Wild West! @TheJonesCode @tigheklory @LnghrnEngineer When people think Nintendo they think games. Their hardware was never that great. @ryman1 Not sure. Hadn't really planned on it... @ramair1997 Haha that's funny. @TheJonesCode @tigheklory Bingo. @tigheklory @waffledog @blkdog7 First market day since the phenomenon took hold? Nintendo should let hardware go. Bu they won't, so next best thing would be a Nintendo Android phone with exclusive apps. Spooky Pinball open house. My mom playing America's Most Haunted. "OH my those ghosts are scary!" https://t.co/QXa7JNOytE RT @MacroFab: This was a BIG ONE! Podcast Ep. #23 with @benheck of The Ben Heck Show! https://t.co/F10E93gE4E https://t.co/qkxdsDs1IY @JonathanCellini MS should have bought them instead of LinkedIn. Pokémon Go is a hit, to the shock of no one. Nintendo! Stop making hardware. Start making money. 60 million consoles ready for your games. Time to make the fish cry like an anime fan on prom night. https://t.co/vb3Rceft6v @ChadSeiter Haven't caught any big ones yet. It's a huge Lake we need to find a good spot. "We will not go silently back to the cabin!  This will be our Fishdependence Day!" https://t.co/1O2GxN8yZj @kwownoname Baby foxes? @givezerofx I bought one as a joke because I saw the funny Mr T infomercial but then grew to love it! @JohnJohnston1 They sure do! Steaks, chicken, meatloaf, whole turkeys... Brought my Nuwave Oven on my fishing trip. Because it makes awesome everything! https://t.co/OIwRsMvVvN "9 minutes to work" Google tells me on a Saturday. I think not! This time, I'm going on a fishing trip! @LnghrnEngineer DNR approved. New Glarus expands into boat drinking! @LnghrnEngineer CANS? New podcast! https://t.co/Y90h0I2Taz Half-gen consoles, E3 stories, Uncharted VS Tomb Raider and much more! Enjoy and happy 4th! Yahoo 9 days off. Time to catch all the fish.  Nom nom nom. @UHcougarFausto Not as good as the sublime Uncharted 2, but better than 3 and 4. @DarkSamus79 I don't think so. @DarkSamus79 I'm only an hour or two in, but so far I'm liking it more. So far, Tomb Raider Rises &gt; Uncharted 4. Less climbing, more action, no sidekicks, enemies die in 2 shots, stealth kills, supernatural stuff @tigheklory @TheJonesCode @GuyHutchinson Sadly, most Americans do not. Why did formulaic crap like Ice Age outgross Lilo &amp; Stitch? @tigheklory @TheJonesCode @GuyHutchinson Also, skyrocketing costs. Disney's live-action remakes are about half the price of a Pixar film. @tigheklory @TheJonesCode @GuyHutchinson CGI movies was one of those watershed moments that immediately made everything else obsolete. @tigheklory @TheJonesCode @GuyHutchinson Maybe the flood of cheap Flash-animated TV shows watered down the value? @tigheklory @TheJonesCode @GuyHutchinson Yeah, but 2D animation is dead. @Dieboldly Thanks for letting us take apart the rare prototype! @House_Alfieri What was the return address on it? @Sonikku_a @BenHeckShow @element14 @theHeckwKaren Be sure to watch the episode and see what we find! Sony-SNES teardown and repair will be on the July 15th episode of @BenHeckShow on @element14 @theHeckwKaren https://t.co/9aThbohwCW @bowenkerins @BenHeckShow @ReplayFX We are logging a lot of info on the console so Dan and Terry can share it at shows. We have the Sony-Nintendo CD-ROM prototype in our show. Repairing it for a future @BenHeckShow episode. @theHeckwKaren @thebenheckshow &lt;squeak!&gt; Our opening box office over and under betting. So far I am unstoppable! I think ID42 will do better than expected. https://t.co/JKnijOdQhp @twitchplayskh @theHeckwKaren Backflip Films (show production company) has done the Bw3 wing challenge a stupid amount of times. We are live-streaming LASER DAY from our shop, join the fun on Ustream! https://t.co/NfVVmKz0Ql @f5kn It would need a skull. Skull and xbones! @Barnacules Just noticed your YouTube channel is paused in a background shot of an episode we're working on. Haha keep an eye out for it! @thestudcomic "I want you to draw me like one of your Redmond consoles..." @RoyEltham It's really small. Look at the scale of the controller. Kate Winslet aside, Xbox One S is pretty cool. Think I'll get 2, one to use, the other to make into a laptop or something. Turns out the top secret design of the Xbox One S was leaked years ago at the Oscars of all places... https://t.co/ulBDUZgDFP Spooky Pinball documentary coming this fall https://t.co/8ULxt8r2AJ was interviewed for it last year! @Forchy @majornelson I'd guess not, as that was intended for their grand cable-box plans that never materialized. Plus plugs cost money. "Honey, remember that MMO you were sick of me playing 10 years ago? Wanna pack up the kids and spend $60 seeing a movie based on it?" @tigheklory @TheJonesCode And "Dragon" is Iron Giant with dragons. The *real* reason Finn was assigned to garbage duty. https://t.co/jTFSg10HNM @MNeko was at a movie screening and during a reboot it looked like Windows 2000. Even had the "Live Desktop" how old is that? The hotel has Crashed to Desktop. https://t.co/hVWcRClk5P Second day of Rocky Mountain Pinball Showdown. My talk is at 2pm. Be sure to play Rob Zombie and America's Most Haunted! Billy Mitchell and Donkey Kong. A photo op I couldn't resist. https://t.co/wKhuSbPmzv @1stage @TEDTalks A Michael Bay TED talk would be utterly fascinating. I'd really like to know why Transformers makes so much money. @RoyEltham @cwkraft Last gen was stretched too far. Honestly we should be on NEXT gen already. @cwkraft Everyone on YouTube will make videos bitching about these consoles... Then go right out and buy them. @cwkraft It has a lot of food options. Just landed in Denver. Realized this is my first time coming *to* Denver rather than just connecting in airport. @Forchy MS was really,  really cautious with heat this gen. Ps4 has basically the same core but heat sink half the size! @Forchy I'd guess they'll make a slimmed down xb1 soon. I think it's huge size is big part of why people don't like it. PS4 Neo. Xbox One Scorpio. Let's take what customers and devs love about consoles... AND THROW IT OUT A F**KING WINDOW! @aaronights That's usually what I do. Or crazy coupon cat ladies. But I always get it wrong. Airports, grocery, everywhere. Beginning to think my superpower is "Ability to always pick the slowest line for anything" @Barnacules @eevblog Though should have made it "Can you find the capacitor?" and kids had to turn arrow to correct symbol. @Barnacules @eevblog It was many episode back, maybe 2014? @Barnacules @eevblog We did one once. I turned a kids The Cow Says toy into a Dave Jones quote generator. @1stage @Gizmodo It won't be long before Hollywood makes certain movies just for China and skips US release altogether. @robitgames Well, make it work with either right or left. Minimize thumb movement to ensure a good grip. @eevblog @Sonysoftware @MAGIX_INT Hey that's a local company here in Madison, WI I will be speaking at Rocky Mountain Pinball Showdown this weekend in Denver. https://t.co/W5qt5CUYgI Stop by and hear great stories! @Conor_The_Geek Not yet. We want to though! Just haven't had the time to develop it. @tigheklory @lesoleil70 @LnghrnEngineer Those chips can be obtained off eBay for much cheaper than a Colecovision. @dartfrogdk It certainly dipped well out of the limelight, and then came back. I think it was GenXers became parents and rebought them :) @michaeljnelson Not using "Now You Don't" shows a stunning lack of faith in audience intelligence. Which, given Transformers, is justified. @LnghrnEngineer Yeah. Like Marvel and Apple, at one point it nearly died. I wonder how much of the "Fall of LEGO" had to do simply with parents getting sick of stepping on them barefoot? @hylianlikely We have plenty of old shirts could mail you one. Email me via my website. @richthofen The strength of Windows is running legacy apps. Without that, who cares? @dj_backbreaker We don't because there's no way we can cobble something together that will work as well any even the cheapest tablet. If MS really wants a phone, make it an x86 Surface device, top of the line, with features that power users want (USB host, keyboard cover) It's amazing to me that Microsoft doesn't understand the true value of Windows, which is IT RUNS EVERYTHING. Yet they want ARM devices? @simon_t_rose Darn! Yeah it was late in the day so nothing was running. I've always thought movie props would be an interesting career. @theHeckwKaren You're welcome. A taste of Germany! @stulec52 @TheJonesCode The accent is only present in the 1988 section. That's the weird part. @LnghrnEngineer I just feel movies are heading for a crash. Quality going down, price &amp; supply going up. When has that EVER worked? @LnghrnEngineer Something like $160 million. Honestly they should have made it 10 years ago, or waited 8 more for it to be nostalgic. @AtomicHarbour They make twice what movie industry does. Who needs respect? @TheJonesCode @stulec52 But WTF was up with Winslet's accent? if ((numberOfSubs * 10) &lt; budgetOfMovie) { return dontMakeMovie; } a code snippet the makers of Warcraft should have considered. @TheJonesCode @stulec52 Reminds me, I watched and really enjoyed "Steve Jobs" movie. @stulec52 @TheJonesCode I think I saw someone using a Windows Phone in Germany but since I didn't meet them, it doesn't count. @SvenMertens1 Obvious, yet very funny!

Needs more hallways and random battles. Angry Birds isn't a bomb, so expect every other app on your phone to be greenlit to a cinematic universe by Tuesday. App movie  title ideas? Ah, my work week has finally ended at 9:20 PM. Time to finish DOOM! @LnghrnEngineer But Jeeps already have an indicator waning you they're about to break... It's the Jeep logo :) @LnghrnEngineer Now they just need a good IDE! Shocking how that hasn't happened yet. @MakerSylvia Cool! Sorry I haven't been to any big Maker Faires lately... Falls and springs have been busy :( @tigheklory Should be a rule of business: Don't enter a battle you've already lost. Work arguments about whether Scrooge McDuck is Donald's brother or uncle end quickly thanks to the Internet. @coolboy8310 Not a judgment of the shows. Simply their theme songs. Duck Tales sounded like it was written in an afternoon. @makenai I guess Scrooge's non-invested money stockpile plan probably worked out well in '08. It's time our nation faced a hard truth... The theme song to "Gummi Bears" is actually far better than the one for "Duck Tales". @EEichstadt @DOOM So far I'd say yes. Super-simple @DOOM review: "It's the Fury Road of Gaming" "Demonic presence at unsafe level" implies there is an acceptable level of it? Maybe it's like USDA allowing X amount of bugs in food? This is pretty cool. Has a Quad copter motor grinding and extruding CMYK filament into a full color print. https://t.co/IJG9X1kT2K @zen_studios @VirtualPinball1 @ABCSharkTank Did they get the deal? Be cool if pinball was more mainstream. @theHeckwKaren Why isn't Kylo Ren married? Because he's Ben Solo his whole life. @geekbuilders Sadly no. Pretty busy month as-is. #spoonfail https://t.co/LGvktHuTUK My sister has a weird name. @kwownoname So much so, there aren't even any fan-fiction hedgehogs named after her. @whoisdavidlewis Clean as best you can, and inspect traces with a meter. Looks like corrosion. @adobe @creativecloud should strive to be as consistent across apps as Microsoft Office (a much cheaper product) is. @LnghrnEngineer Just empty every pocket because jerks engineered every part @GamerOnWheelz Yes check my website. @Klickvieh We learned that from "The Mummy" This seems pretty cool. What do you all think? https://t.co/hsFKx3RHse Worth the money? @mrpointyhead23 We did a Fallout 4-inspired one for the PS4 recently. I saw the GIF on reddit. @cheobbtv Check https://t.co/m7XwqM70pL thanks! Companies: Spamming me with calls wanting to waste my time rating customer service is, in and of itself, bad customer service. @eevblog @pcworld People need to learn from Apple: if you can't win a market, create a new one. See also Windows phone. @futurebird And print design on paper to make sure your IC's fit the landing parts for the libraries. Paper = cheap. PCB mistake = costly @futurebird Double check that libraries match pinouts, align all parts to same grid, make sure vias have clearance... @LnghrnEngineer It has an entire scene of him talking to a computer telling it to scan around corners in a grainy photo. @LnghrnEngineer Which one? Blade Runner? I'd readily agree it's overrated and loved mostly for its visuals. @LnghrnEngineer Losing the voiceover helped. But on release, test audiences probably didn't know WTF was going on first half of movie. It's great that they've found most of "Metropolis" but the longer it gets the less I like it. Reminds me of Cameron's special editions. @theHeckwKaren Yes. Yes you did. Unfortunately, none of them are "Twitter Safe" except maybe "Abduct My Heart" We ordered some cakes to celebrate #alienDay426 https://t.co/ffPDLkUzly @CromulentOne @theHeckwKaren A more common brand name is Komatex. I get mine from Midland Plastics. @tigheklory @LnghrnEngineer Solar windows! Maybe transparent? Wonder if that would work? Enjoyed 2nd season of Daredevil though it had too much Scott Glenn and ninjas. Didn't know that was possible. In honor of #Earthday I turned off my shop heat since I'm the only one here at the moment :) @OpSourceNetwork @thunderf00t @eevblog @SolarRoadways You are engineering in reverse - trying to make a pre-determined solution work.

I'll tweet when I know for sure. @StuartSJones Cool. Should be an interesting trip! @tigheklory Amazon. Our local Best Buy has hardly any parts anymore. @tigheklory Yeah that's what I just stuck in. EVGA GT 740 SC. It was cheap. @pmjordan Shop PC "couldn't start device" so PC kept booting into 640x480 mode. I have bad luck with video cards. On average, I go through 2 per computer's lifetime. Guess it's better than hard drive failures... @eevblog @SolarRoadways @thunderf00t Imagine how many real engineering scholarships that money could have been used for. @Sonikku_a Oh no. Does this mean I've officially drawn Sonic fan art? #Deviantart @lesoleil70 @8bitcoder Oh sweet! Heard someone was working on this. ULA = unobtainium. @jeriellsworth MRE's Saw two strange things today. First was a Harley rider wearing a helmet. Second was a nun randomly walking down a sidewalk. @tomfgoodwin @Veronica That also applies to Google Now, or maybe worse considering it triggers off "ok" @TheJonesCode Sick burn. Been absolutely slammed since getting back from New Zealand, but this weekend am finally caught up enough for NETFLIX MARATHON! @Prog98 If Angry Birds can get a movie, why can't Clippy? "Clippy Begins: Origins Retribution" I've seen videos where Siri and Cortana talk to each other. I wonder if at some point they both use the restroom and discuss IBM's Watson. Is that one of those Tiny House things? https://t.co/MyaDkg10cK @TimothySCarter All I remember is Olsen twin was 1 kid, some guy lived above garages, and.... San Francisco? @tigheklory The most-right thing Sony did with PS4 was give it a super-explanatory name (versus XB1 and WiiU) @tigheklory "Because you watched Werner Herzog's Cave of Forgotten Dreams, you might like Adam Sandler's Ridiculous 6!" However, I do respect such a simple, stupid name as "Fuller House" in a world of "Thing You Like Begins: Origins Retribution" @tigheklory Thankfully, logging in and out ended the nightmare. My smart TV's Netflix was stuck on Fuller House splash screen. It was a waking nightmare, like my tooth crown falling out last month. @darkcat1 @LnghrnEngineer From the photos on his phone of the guts, looked MUCH closer to a SNES than what PS1 became. @darkcat1 @LnghrnEngineer Even if fixed no games to play. It would be cool just to learn what it was spec-wise. Joe Decuir, the guy who designed my first home computer I had as a kid. Good to see him again after all these years! https://t.co/l3t9XhzDAj @makenai @theHeckwKaren Haha not many. But it does have a socketed 68K on it. @MorRobots @theHeckwKaren The answer is...  ALL OF THEM! Actually mostly EPROM. I was jealous of @theHeckwKaren so I bought this JAMMA board for parts and also did the Link pose! https://t.co/D7VT4UJ1ad @theHeckwKaren found a Zelda game and then held it in the like Link does. (insert sound effect here) https://t.co/IkpNN88RyO @livelinkon Avoid the Nintendo prices getting crazy Haha @RoyEltham @LnghrnEngineer He didn't say no. From his pics, ICs looked closer to souped up SNES (twin PPUs) than what PS became. @LnghrnEngineer and I met the guy who has the SNES PS1 prototype. (and asked if we could take it apart :) https://t.co/XIluLXNRfC Trying to get back to Milwaukee for MGC tonight. So far it has involved planes, trains and automobiles.

Also, I really miss Sky Mall. @hungarianhc Oh right. Yes it's a Book. Confusing as there's a Surface, Surface Pro and a Book. I put my Microsoft Surface Pro into "airplane mode". https://t.co/JWQxkZAVEM Well, this should be an interesting weekend. Here we Goooooooooo!

Been so busy... so 3 weeks from now I have "Netflix Binge Veg-Out Weekend" scheduled. Just have to make it that far... If you are in New Jersey on Sat. April 9, come hear me talk at TEDxNavesink! Use code "BHeck" for 20% off tickets https://t.co/gdNp52aeSL @TheJonesCode @DNauertz Those are crime procedural films with a guy dressed as Batman in them. @DNauertz When another superhero movie has an old woman crying when he nephew won't take a $20 bill, let me know. @RetroSwimAU May be the first episode we used Audio Recording Belt... Not sure... Iron Watch why not put band around hand? Then you'd have more area to fold armor out of. Else it's Transformers BS. https://t.co/DzdsCHoEpW @MetroidSlayerP7 Suitcase suit was at least... Plausible. And they took the time to show how it deployed. Why doesn't this "Iron Watch" use the band at all? Wouldn't that have a lot more armor potential? https://t.co/bT9bfKydQN @ChrisTheFraser Eh, think Nintendo should be more worried about all the casual gamers who have jumped to tablets and phones. @jrronimo @tigheklory Nintendo consoles needs 3rd party as well. They've been pissing that away for 20 years now. @tigheklory Not saying it's a bad thing. In fact it's the future. But people expecting an x86 monster will be disappointed. @vandorb12 Releasing an under powered console with a gimmick that scares away 3rd party is pretty consistent to predict. @Qushery I guess we'll see. @SomeBitterDude That's going to be the system. Probably virtual face buttons that change with context. I suspect Nintendo NX will be an ARM/Android portable, digital only games, with HDMI dongle. Anyone expecting a "PS4 killer" = disappointed. @Zittware Think I may have played 10 whole games of pinball the entire show. Which is how it usually goes. I've done shows with zero! @CromulentOne Paul Walker dying in car = coincidence. A horse dying during filming of Furious 8 = irony. @KaseyRelford Haha yes. Though Congo is a pretty good pin as well. John Trudeau looks pretty happy. He finally got to make a pinball based off a license that doesn't suck! https://t.co/rV7tv0PioW If you're waiting in line outside for BBQ #itmustbetexas https://t.co/Lmg4Lynfi2 Texas Pinball Festival.

Doing code updates with an insurance claim AMH that literally "fell off the back of a truck" (still works) Just landed in Dallas. Heading to TPF. I only did a little last minute coding on thr plane :) I am very sad. Earlier, I came across a very good example of how to use "literally" properly, then forgot what it was. I will be at the Texas Pinball Festival this weekend in Dallas. First public showing of Rob Zombie pinball. Doing talk on Saturday as well. @theHeckwKaren I will find all the loopholes in your rules hahaha! @ip_v1 @element14 Nice! Good work. @Mad_Bike_Life It's almost somewhat circular! @theHeckwKaren "Corn starch - it's almost like little ball bearings" On-the-fly addressing would be helpful too. Amazon app could connect to your Calendar and predict where you'll likely be on a Sunday. @sbloom85 Yeah they pay some postal workers to do it. We also have a distribution center in WI now. Amazon idea: A calendar where you say what delivery address is best based on day of the week. Don't attempt work delivery on a Sunday! @CromulentOne Don't worry eventually well make more movies. Someday. Maybe. Watching Samurai Cop double feature and eating wings so spicy "our lips are burned" With each reboot, movie costumes become more textured. Spider-Man has been rebooted so much his textures now exceed the camera's resolution. Heighway Pinball Full Throttle at our local pinball tourney! https://t.co/q9XAu2M5tI @VicVinegarII Nope!

Wonder how much juice left in tube? @tigheklory @TheJonesCode A criminally underrated movie that people bag on simply for having dodgy CGI crocodiles.

I think I'll cancel #netflix once I've watched Daredevil and House of Cards. Nothing else there! Amazon Add-On Subscription Channels is like Uber: As soon as you use it, you know the old ways of cable (or taxis) is doomed. @TimmyTechTV Yes it's on https://t.co/j1nza00nIw @TheJonesCode @frasermoo @stulec52 Don't worry. The next possum suit will be much improved. I promise you won't get stabbed by any bolts. Ate a buffalo burger for lunch, then brushed snow off my car in the cold using only natural lighting #wheresMYoscar? Could George Miller actually have a shot at Best Director? @_metalslugger No but I've thought about trying to make the bitmapped Hell raiser cart. @_metalslugger The was a disk drive add on in Japan. Look at the shenanigans my co-workers were up to while I was away: https://t.co/S85IWV3Ez8 #Deadpool success may finally get Hollywood to acknowledge "shocking statistic" that majority of consumers are adults able to watch R films. Haven't watched a lick of new X-Files, been away. Worth my time? Wait for Netflix? Or is it all "old people jokes"? #gingerScullyFTW @thisoldeconsole @TheMADE @vghmuseum Yeah, could be a possibility! Email me and I could forward you to the decision makers. @rabid_inventor Yes and amazingly it was done in 3 days! Last parts bolted on a few hours before my vacation flight time. @MetroidSlayerP7 GB basically has 2 halves. We removed and rebuilt the front half (screen, audio, controls) and kept the back. @mattjbaldo That would have been a bit much for our schedule. Giant Gameboy uses original hardware (CPU RAM and cart slot) We just rebuilt the screen as VGA via FPGA. https://t.co/R1QfxQeotQ @supernova_giddo @YouTube Yes it turned out quite well! Seems like there's a live band in every bar and restaurant in Charleston. And grits. https://t.co/xEldwr3yMk @AsorensenAlex Well of course you could. What is your purpose? @ShockSlayer Sadly I won't be at MGC this year either. The local event is called Protocon. Now on my way to Charleston, SC for a new convention. Never been to that city before! @TheJonesCode @tigheklory @brokentoken "Ugggggghhhhhhhhhh......." @TheJonesCode @tigheklory @brokentoken To throw gas on this fire, I didn't like Young Frankenstein. Back in the US! Still got a bit of travel before I get home though. Tagline idea for the Auckland Sky Tower: "You can see your whole trip from here" https://t.co/QEWwmu5M9o @thisoldeconsole Lifetime channel...  "He was the perfect time husband... Until he wasn't!" @badboybubby69 @BBCNews That's pretty cool! Hope it's an FPGA and not Android, like the wank Neo Geo a few years back. It's going to be interesting to see the fallout when cable / live TV finally implodes and had only sports to fall back on. @cwkraft That's why React World trademark went badly - 90% of YT is just reacting and channels got super spooked. Packing up and starting the long journey back home. Got one more day in Auckland though. I found Dory. https://t.co/43ypZWFQCO Ironically, Hobbiton is a lot bigger than I expected. https://t.co/Iq4jLSYIXh Think I'll collect some props for Possumus 3 before I leave, since we'll make it... Eventually. @ivanstefek @jeriellsworth Again? Yeah, heard that all new buildings in Wellington have to have "earthquake shocks" installed now. @ivanstefek @jeriellsworth I'm still here till Wednesday. There was an earthquake? @jeriellsworth It's tomorrow in New Zealand, rest assured nothing happened :) Towel = Kiwi autopilot. https://t.co/976g942Rne Feels like Creature from the Black Lagoon...  Tour of Lake Rotomahana. (which is redundant, like Sahara Desert) https://t.co/Awf9BjrzAt It's a real life Bog of Eternal Stench! Except fewer Muppets, and it kind of smells like bacon for some reason. https://t.co/J8uwCHx5yA I couldn't care less about watching #Deadpool , but I hope it does well for the sake of future mainstream R-rated movies. Wellington Airport has a giant Gollum trying to catch raw and wiggling fish. Like in Hayward,  WI! Sort of. https://t.co/WcVBjSP1ag Breakfast hashtag #hash pretty yummy! https://t.co/Fc9hbqCe1F @Lunnaku That makes sense. So what to do in Wellington? Not leaving til tomorrow morning. Thoughts or suggestions? @BananaF4p It was kind of. Like an old bank. What a beautiful old building... Oh wait it's a Burger King? https://t.co/akAB5dy83O @bighatdev @eevblog Flew on my friends Piper Cub once. Small and 70 years old https://t.co/qTcVfJZmds @echoskope Hardly any different than a small jet. I guess I'm kind of disappointed? Now I'm in Wellington. Seems like a cool place. Going to wander for a bit... @eevblog Puddle jumpers in US are always 3 seat wide Embraer jets. Never anything with a prop. @renderman7 @benheck I don't like how it smells of a dentist office inside though. Looks like a dual prop passenger plane! Have never flown in one before (commercial I mean) https://t.co/KhUBW2TdvN @kwownoname @benheck I thought you wanted her to get a pet pug instead? @kwownoname Maybe they sell Hobbits? They'd fit easily into an overhead bin. @kwownoname If I see something in the gift shop you might like I'll be sure to buy it! @kwownoname I will not get to Hobbiton early, or late. I shall arrive precisely when I mean to! Rotorua airport is tiny! Fingers crossed I get to fly to Wellington in a dual prop passenger plane. @woden325 Hey, maybe even 2! @tigheklory Is that the cheap knockoff version? 10,000 Movies In One! See even kids in New Zealand want the Space Shuttle back. Time for the first billion dollar Kickstarter I think! https://t.co/2OKmWkNo2u @beforelogic @janeanegarafalo They're rattling things off a script anyway "your order is important I'm happy to help" Why NOT use an actor? @tigheklory Haha more like all the kids looking for big break. Just had a great idea. Run a call center out of Hollywood using underemployed actors. Act like calls "truly are important" to their clients. @theHeckwKaren Nope. Just needs a little WD-40, right? Gears found in abandoned factory on White Island, NZ. @cwdoan Yeah could see that by the scores. @kwownoname Eating before the snap. Halfway to the goal. First down. @kwownoname That... Is certainly something. What penalty would TC get I wonder? @kwownoname The other cat players would trip over her and fumble. @kwownoname Put TC in it. She could be a linebacker. @MyMobiusMind Yup it is. Like the surface of an alien world. Darn. Missed the Super Bowl. Was too busy landing on a volcano island via helicopter. https://t.co/1jAOC5ylNC @tigheklory At least for LOTR. Whereas Hobbit contained all the most beautiful green screens NZ could offer. "New Zealand. Simply point your camera in any direction, snap a photo, and presto! Instant postcard!" https://t.co/uVJSHuU2vp @JohnMilkspill @aaronights Ah no, what is it some kind of kit? @xxrxndxvxs @LnghrnEngineer Hey, I worked really hard to be ABLE to go on vacation haha. @LnghrnEngineer @tigheklory Oh god you opened a can of Pandora's worms by asking Parker that... @LnghrnEngineer Look at those big juicy caps! @LnghrnEngineer I'm leaning away from the space plot.... Cool bike racks here. Looks like those hand strength flexers stuck in concrete. https://t.co/mfnQz7kbpE @LnghrnEngineer Shh! You're giving away the plot for Possumus 3. @LnghrnEngineer Even disposable diapers? @aaronights Are there many fans down here? I will be back in Auckland one night before I leave. Also Wellington one night. @LnghrnEngineer bet it smells good! Like a roasted possum. I found the word "rent" in New Zealand! https://t.co/xpAfVvWrtj @RadioRaptorFM @eevblog I couldn't deduce what they are connected to. @JohnMilkspill Yes. No one can find me down here haha. Solar frigging benches! @eevblog Again, yes, put panels anywhere but a road. https://t.co/OjwOpmL1I2 Pride+Prejudice+Zombie baffles me. Spent eons in development, during which time nobody realized [as a movie] it was a sure-fire bomb? @44thats44oars Microsoft Internet Pro keyboard. Have same model at home been using since 2000! I buy NOS from eBay. Probably gambling more likely than SNK Fun World but might be worth a look later on. https://t.co/abPaZzjey3 @TheJonesCode Yes. Going is what I plan to do. I can learn how to make better possums. @TheJonesCode Could... Not go? As a movie buff, decided I couldn't NOT goto the WETA tour since I'm so close. Doing the longer evening dinner one. @field_hamster Not making it to South Island sorry. BASIC worked great! Super yacht traffic jam. https://t.co/QL6zu7Oisz Miles? And meters? This sign went to the Prometheus school of inconsistency. https://t.co/8IaBQx1pFV Real dolphins! Also, if you're on the fence about prescription sunglasses, they're worth every penny. https://t.co/yHLVZweFU3 @mrdrmuffin Oh you're lucky we had to order it in! @TheONiLX @mrdrmuffin Good stuff Max found it https://t.co/VZWnmkRziz will certainly use it again! @PhilipFreidin haha I could taste it! Vegamite. Imagine if a bullion cube was made of jelly... Contains 150% of your daily allowance of salt. https://t.co/VcefVbYONs @yesterbits @eBay Yeah pretty sure I just built one. @davanti I'm visiting the country at the moment. Apparently New Zealand has its own version  of State Street. https://t.co/rn4ajfBx99 @TheJonesCode @PortablesofDoom @eagle5953 @cwkraft Jones, you must GET IN THERE and take my place! @eagle5953 @PortablesofDoom @cwkraft  It's true. My TedX talk landed on same weekend. @cwkraft Oh of course it lands on the one weekend that month I have to be someplace else. Just like TedX and MGC. @cwkraft When is that? @theHeckwKaren What if I told you all proceeds went to Gator-Aid 2016? We need that money to get Vanilla Ice to perform. @thanius @Spacekatgal @sWooZ1e @feliciaday @TimOfLegend They also need a category "YouTubers who don't scream at camera entire time" @f5kn Biggest issue is there's nothing for Rocketeer to DO with rocket. If stolen from German lab in WW2, lot more action potential. @nustar1 I didn't realize it was common until maybe a year ago. It probably signifies regret or something. @jbrasnake Could remake plastic parts with a 3D printer. Looks pretty old. Labyrinth remake? A bunch of soulless CGI  creatures? There's only one Jennifer Connelly film that should be remade, and it's Rocketeer. Got a new debit, updated all my auto-pays. And thought "Why I am still paying for Netflix?" I watch YouTube and Amazon Video much more. Going to be in New Zealand next month. How "worth it" is a trip to WETA Workshop? Anyone been there for a tour? Upon its release Costner's Robin Hood was called "dark joyless somber" But it's outright cheerful compared to modern "dark gritty reboots" What happened to "My Itinerary" on Expedia? Oh, guess that was too big of a word, now it's just "My Trips" @Antijingoist I forget ALL SORTS OF THINGS just ask anybody that knows me. David Bowie Alan Rickman movie night (Labyrinth and Robin Hood) Similarities include: different eye colors, owls, and half brothers. @pathartl @TheJonesCode How they heck did they get in there to swap it out? It's fairly well bolted to the front shell. @TheJonesCode It shall be avenged! @arcadehack @Lord_Arse @Highwaygames It's a TinyCircuits kit with analog controls. Variant on Arduino Uno https://t.co/SOI7K7UMvi @jamesfield @eevblog @Chris_Gammell Ha! Nice. @flufflogic I thought Netflix stopped end of video autoplay a while back? Netflix Ridiculous 6 their top movie? Proves the huge gap between what people will watch in theaters (very little) vs home video (anything) @LPDigitalMedia @HuffingtonPost Fine by me. @Raz4life Must have been a clone. @thisoldeconsole Ah... Deltas should be faster but are limited by extruder. Cartesian seems more proved at this point. My overly complicated loose filament spooler with snap on end. https://t.co/un6wa7pTTM Latest MakerWare, I can run 2 printers off same PC, identified by their EEPROM names. Sweet. https://t.co/gHQ70mQUDb @TheJonesCode Yeah its pretty common actually. Paying multiple rents incurs a version of the "I forgot to attend that class all semester" dream only it's forgetting to pay a certain rent. Ultra HD 4K Blu-Ray? Requires new players? If it can't work on PS4 or Xbox One (do either have HDMI 3.0?) this format is DOA. @theHeckwKaren Don't forget "You were the chosen bear!" @sgeers1 In and out shift registers are pretty useful. @tigheklory @k3v2 Gaming nostalgia older than 2000 that doesn't involve Nintendo is dead. @mst3kfag "Four a day!" Love the giant filters, haha. I doubt smoking will be legal 200 years in future. Could be a cool build! Can't quite put your finger on what's missing in Fallout 4? https://t.co/sdsoyaqn2v My in-depth analysis!

We're using screws and carbon fiber for these now. @pathartl "Let's Burn" Whoever makes "Fireplace For Your Home" video but with random, interesting things being thrown into it will make a fortune. #capacitors @TheJonesCode @tigheklory Consternation? @TheJonesCode @tigheklory Nobody can sit in a chair like Andy Serkis. @TheJonesCode Cuts down a wall of enemies to save the day emerges from smoke "Mesa back" If Hollywood learns one lesson from 2015, it should be that remakes only work when disguised as sequels (Jurassic World, Creed, Star Wars) @Tc1492 Had to fix some traces on the keyboard too - battery corrosion can get everywhere! It lives! Good for another 30 years for sure. https://t.co/r76SKRpreS A column is out on my beloved TRS-80 100. Think some corrosion got to the LCD bonding layer. Carefully dismantle... https://t.co/Gc78Z8gb1Y @Zittware Maybe 2 minutes? Whenever I hear that Paramore song "The Only Exception" all my brain hears is "UART, the only connection..." @pdp7 @element14 Exactly! Though ironically he bought a Surface 3 because our Linux server wouldn't print pages from from his Linux PC :) 2nd gen ZX portable may be my favorite of any I've done. It's small, yet still "original hardware" with USB charger. https://t.co/9kdT6gSVAK #starwars "Whadda want this Kylo Ren costume to look like?" "I dunno, how about a black 2010 Ford Focus?" @thestudcomic Probably but it was faster to beef up the driver than redo the lid. We always do what's faster because schedule. Have this week off. Allows me to goto Post Office at what I hope is least busy time (around 10am) @isocube Links on my website https://t.co/jeupwohdX5. Some mentioned our podcast listed at only 9 minutes. It calculated wrong, all 2 hours are really there. Will enter manually next time. @facelessloser Planning to do a Star Wars follow up after Tuesday, when we will have both seen it twice. @nightwheel Um no... Closer to 2 hours! @PackerBackerSTL @LnghrnEngineer Sweet! Hope you like it. MS want people to love 10? Make things just WORK, why should I have to sign into Windows AND Onedrive AND Sykpe? (all same account!) @Screamintuna By 2020 comic movies are going to be completely burned out. @tigheklory As someone who hated Into Darkness with the fire of a thousand suns, I enjoyed TFA. A horrible fall box office + Star Wars making $ proves people want to see movies there's just too many and the cost makes them chose wisely. @MorRobots It's an entertaining remake of Ep4. Yes also hoping future films tell new stories and not just "Empire" remake #noMoreDeathStars #StarWarsTheForceAwakens JJ Abrams rebooted my childhood! @mattjbaldo Yes to all. My Xmas present to myself: An awesome industrial glue gun! https://t.co/EkDApAiJLR @theHeckwKaren None. None color. @tehaynes @altonbrown Meatloaf is awesome! I love to make it in my NuWave oven https://t.co/JkYRHGRpe6 Save greenhouses gases, critics! #StarWarsTheForceAwakens only requires a 3 word review: "IT DOESN'T SUCK!" @cwkraft Especially considering it's going from a pressurized environment to the vacuum of space. @DNauertz You haven't seen the poster? Of course there is. But now it's 20 times bigger. @cwkraft Yeah, save $10 on metal, lose $90 trillion when Death Star blows up. @cwkraft I guess the port could double back, very much like a toilet. https://t.co/UQfgDTy9JW #deathStarInsurance "Item 1e: Must be covered by multiple shield generators, guarded by troops with rock and stick-proof armor" #deathStarInsurance "Item 1d: When building a Death Star, the outer shell should be completed first and be free of all ship-sized gaps" #deathStarInsurance "Item 1c: All exhaust ports must be covered with a mesh of some sort with apertures smaller than a photo torpedo" @PowerFlowerGen The array is inside the turbine? @PowerFlowerGen What is it again? Oh yeah that's right! @TheJonesCode and I made another podcast! Enjoy https://t.co/0FA6TGTypL Force Awakens... do any of the space ships fly through... you know... SPACE in this movie? Also, I expect it will almost be a remake of Ep4. @pokojowczykmat Don't have one yet! @tigheklory @waffledog I would actually set my TV on fire before watching that. @TheJonesCode Yeah! So what do people think we should discuss? Ripping on Nintendo will happen regardless. @TheJonesCode Ventrilo. Actually, I have 2 identical nice Logitech headsets. Maybe we go OLD SCHOOL laptop + PC? @LnghrnEngineer @TheJonesCode Holding a key to talk in Vent might be weird for a podcast... @TigerClaw305 @blkdog7 @tigheklory We used to use 2 computers and 2 USB mics. Guess we still could. Thoughts @TheJonesCode ? @RobZombie  pinball machine reveal, now available for pre-order. https://t.co/edqj9a36E4 Great work team! Jones and I wanna bring podcast back from the dead. Anyone suggest good Skype recording software? The "It Prints Money!" years of Wii/DS tainted Nintendo. Now they make games to sell hardware, instead of making hardware to sell games. @TheIncredibleAf A surface mount HDMI isn't a trivial thing to solder. Maybe try general reflow on the area with heatgun? Excited for the conclusion of MST3K KS https://t.co/DfoktfdGCm but their reward tiers are getting more complex than the US Tax Code. @Michael_Aubry I'm SURE that's what the aroma therapy dispenser was talking about :) Seen on a Xmas gift. Hertz per second? Is that like dividing by zero? https://t.co/8y7IxQYYmc @sgeers1 Don't those pens dry up pretty quick? @Sonikku_a Civil War, mash Y to hack off gangrenous foot. Likewise in FPS games, every country has gone to "modern warfare" with every other country. Thus I suggest "rebooting" back to WW2 BF or COD TV shows are usually near their end once every character has dated every other possible character. @LnghrnEngineer Gee, what could this be for, I wonder? :) @jamesfield Yeah. Home viewing allowed me to get through 2nd and 3rd Hobbit movies, after the ordeal of seeing Part 1 in theaters. @jamesfield Ever notice when people ask "is that out yet?" they mean on video. If seeing a movie at home is a better service, it will win. Movie box office been abysmal this fall. Likely a combo of too high prices and Star Wars hype sucking all the air out of the room. @TimothySCarter Any worse than a medallion driver who makes you feel unsafe and there's no way to provide feedback? Used Uber app for first time. In an instant understood the popularity, and why traditional cabs are doomed. @Joshua__Vincent Nice! Sorry I can't respond to every email. @DSelj Maybe. We haven't even gotten one yet! Unstained through hole Pi something we've suggested for a while now. Makes sense! @calebkraft Thanks! Always nice when a simple, straightforward episode is beneficial to people. @PowerFlowerGen So it collects energy via both? @TheJonesCode I don't get it? Felix is working on a big batch of single handed controllers. We're using carbon fiber PLA for some of the parts now https://t.co/km47VdVCfE @mrjlturn3r Very juicy! Real question with Star Wars is what web reviewer will manage to write the first review stating "JJ Abrams Un-Raped My Childhood"? @eevblog I've gotten flagged for alternate edits of my own show posted to my personal channel. @eevblog YouTube could auto flag your content used elsewhere and withhold that person's revenue sharing. @thestudcomic Yeah we did a teardown on one for a future episode. @fatedfox @colon_three I pronounce "multimeter" the same one one does altimeter, speedometer, odometer, pedometer (and so forth :) @eevblog Would be amazing (sad?) to track down what the hospital had to pay for that custom $$$ medical $$$ equipment. @f5kn 6mm PVC foam (Sintra) would be flimsier than plywood. And far more expensive + can't be cut in laser (toxic gas + just melts) @cwkraft I have to work still, to gain money with which to pay electric bill used to power PS4 for the playing of Fallout. @ahicktiger Freestanding is better but more expensive. @MST3K @pattonoswalt @feliciaday SHUT UP AND TAKE MORE OF MY MONEY! @cwkraft Probably springs, gears and nuclear material. Fallout on PS4 counts rest mode as game time? Now I have no way of knowing how much of my life I'm wasting. @ianhamilton_ Really, we have to build so many it's easier to stick with one model. Also the XB1 controller much easier to mod than 360. @UCFH Not sure I understand your purpose. Working on Makerbots today, swapping parts from a dead one like using every part of the buffalo. https://t.co/WIhjsIQQYh @CaldwellOne No but we did deep fry one once. Also good but too much work. @CaldwellOne It's half cooked in this photo. It turned out AWESOME. @f5kn We are doing a Star Wars build, yes. Working today. Feels like a Monday, but it's a Friday. That part's cool. Very cathartic. Also, WTF Packers? Nuwave Oven makes awesome juicy turkey, and in only 2.5 hours. #sayGoodByeToDry https://t.co/8TBsGk72Al @davidjhyatt Zero is cool because easier to add headers than remove them. @tigheklory @darkcat1 @blkdog7 @JoeBrewerrr I have a last model Focus wagon now fits even better nice square hatch opening. It must be pretty disgusting to the 98% of states that can't buy Spotted Cow that anyone in Wisconsin would drink Busch Lite. @TheJonesCode @LnghrnEngineer No server browser though? Is that correct? @TheJonesCode @LnghrnEngineer We're STILL playing Bad Company 2! Almost 7 servers still exist. You're the ones missing out! @Nokterian Watched that already. Worst part is imaging how much they socked a medical institution for that... @cokelogic Yes that game was fun. Seems like an obvious choice for the Shock series, considering it started in space. New Bioshock? Communist city on the moon, please. "I rejected these ideals. I chose.... STALINTOPIA!" (pan over moon rock reveal city) #fallout4 Why do you need to hold breath to steady aim while wearing Power Armor? Plot hole! (still loving game of course :) @TheJonesCode That's... an original choice, I guess. Excited to see "Creed" this week, even though I'm the only Rocky fan who thinks 5 is better than 4 because 4 WAS A MONTAGE NOT A MOVIE. Tomb Raider movie reboot planned, caravan of dump trucks filled with money start journey to Jennifer Lawrence's mansion. @LnghrnEngineer Nice! @tigheklory @waffledog @TheJonesCode @GuyHutchinson I'd be OK with Road House remake if it was Charlize Theron as Dalton's daughter +rated R @HectorBreus Maybe around 30? @LnghrnEngineer @Macro_Ninjaneer "The beer that drinks like a whiskey" @HectorBreus That makes sense. Ubisoft has bought many of them over the years. @HectorBreus What are you using it on? @cwkraft @LnghrnEngineer @TheJonesCode Sounds like exactly what will happen. @tigheklory @TheJonesCode NX will be Android / ARM take that to the bank. @tigheklory @TheJonesCode RIP PowerPC. @SupercellShark Hell no. @TheJonesCode Eh..... I guess. Better than all these darn remastered games I suppose. Backwards compatibility on XB1 is impressive though I've always wondered what the appeal of that is. I buy new consoles for new games. @Dean_Woodyatt We are slowly getting them current. Stay tuned! Crap, Photoshop didn't sync my utter, burning hatred of Scrubby Zoom to this computer. @TheDren Hurry up - those C-rations aren't going to open themselves! @TheDren Believe I bought them - and my "metal match" - off Amazon. Now, just need to go camping! Good thing we have all these P51's around, you know, in case we need to open a can during the Korean War. https://t.co/nZCJIDToac @TheJonesCode I like it but it's really difficult. Don't care for the charging enemies that always get hits on you. Because typos. Typos never changes. https://t.co/q3azpHMY6L @cdigames It will be in a future episode, we may do that "Improve the Steam Controller" challenge thing. We already did a teardown on Steam Controller. Anyone buy the Box or Link? Impressions? I'm kind of confused who this product is for. @MisterTipp They are all online on https://t.co/j1nza00nIw @TheJonesCode Yeah. But I enjoyed it more than either of the Avengers movies. @TheJonesCode Podcast idea: Part 3's the Geeks are Wrong About (X-Men, Terminator, Iron Man) @TheJonesCode This is why more people should join the "T3 Is Pretty Decent" club. We'd hail that movie as a masterpiece now. @TheJonesCode Well what did you think of it? I watched it the other night. @MisterTipp Probably will for Xmas. @TimothySCarter Thanks! But i'm worried that watching @eevblog and working with Australians will improve my Possumus accent. @LnghrnEngineer The color coded responses are hard to see and also not explained. Don't fret that your invention idea is too obvious. Recall that it took over a century for companies to make upside down ketchup bottles. @thebenheckshow We wrote a whole song for PieFace but didn't have time to make a video for it https://t.co/QuNUOjgmey Maybe when he returns? @cwkraft I saw one. It exploded on the newspaper lady. Also, I doubt newspapers will exist in 2287. #BringBackMST3K SyFy should pick it up, then have late-night MST3K showings of their limitless supply of self-produced bad movies. @cwkraft Main quest takes you to East Boston and it's brutal! @woody24 I have that problem too. Trying to remember to do it more. I can't decide if #Fallout4 is really hard, or if other games have just gotten too easy. Thoughts? Much like how there were so many sequels to The Land Before Time I'm surprised the series never made it to present day (see also: Ice Age) Black Friday's start creeping earlier every year... to the point where it will eventually wrap around to the previous Black Friday. @supernova_giddo Nope! @0xJoao The same! But it feels really dated in 2015. Or maybe I just forgot where everything is. #Fallout4 PipBoy clunky and unintuitive, step backwards from Skyrim. Sure it's part of the world but it gets in the way of the game. The apocalypse sure takes a while to install... https://t.co/52csjoKCK3 @MarkSheppard I consider any time keeping me from radroach killing to be stupid. Stupid daylight savings time. A month ago it would have been 3:43, that much closer to quitting time #fallout4 https://t.co/sb2eHDoWUc @Collaborizm You can email me via the link on https://t.co/m7XwqM70pL @aaronights @thebenheckshow Looks interesting! November 10th, 2015. A much better date in the future than pointless Oct. 21st. Is it 5 PM yet? @cr88192 Oh yeah. I laugh when those ancient dinosaurs pop up in Windows 10. @Slot1Gamer I believe those are called profiles. My PS4 even asks who I am, despite being only user. Because Have Disk Dialog Box. Have Disk Dialog Box never changes. @Angel_Jimenez01 A repetitive, padded, redundant joke. I considered Chapter 1 the end of the game. Going to pre-eject Metal Gear V from PS4 to save me a few seconds on Tuesday evening. Chapter 2 of that game is a joke. Listening to football online is too difficult, so I fired up my ancient tube AM radio. Also, WTF Packers? https://t.co/DlP9kgCo2G @sCop3SCouT PC worked fine but Windows Update couldn't run. Everything is on our server anyway. No biggie. Bad RAM damaged my registry, so I'm reinstalling Windows on my work PC. Fun times. Yahoo. @timOoblik @thebenheckshow Haha we suggested he do that for Halloween years ago, but he's not into Halloween. @PlanetKrypt0n None. I just use Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, the latter of which I also rent movies and shows from. CNC nesting example of why I always design things with large, circular knockouts.

Practically "free" compared to film print days. @LnghrnEngineer Do a barrel roll! @danborghoff @geekyteach @pottsedtech @EdTechMaker Sweet! Looks like the original! @sloankelly Ug. They are murdering us. Time to watch some commercials with limited interruptions from a football game. @TimothySCarter Thinking they could be interns and *only* do what the machines can't... Hahaha it's a trap! "Let's increase the supply of movies and also the price!" Economics 101 fail. Theatrical movie-going will continue tanking in America. @JurvaVehasmaa Because I like building props! Un-geeky thing about me #3657: I don't give a flying toss about Halloween. (or any holiday to be fair) @Zittware Duct tape is overrated. Ah, a five pound box of glue sticks. This should last a week or two. https://t.co/ALVY8TZZOJ Is Netflix really 90% reality cooking shows or is that just what I see because I've watched some? @b00gamonkey @tigheklory @blkdog7 They wouldn't. Has nothing to do with storytelling, audiences have rejected it, like B&amp;W or silent movies. @tigheklory @blkdog7 I doubt it. Jem and the Holograms just atom-bombed at the box office. Captain Planet... now maybe that would work. @tigheklory @blkdog7 It's for a pitch reel, not a movie. But no studio will greenlight a 2D animated  movie aimed at 40 year olds, sorry. @mitchbear Does that mean the software is web based? Again, laser cutters are usually just a printer driver (use AI, Inkscape even Word!) @gold_noodle @DaveHilden @thrsn Looks like a line in the display is out oh noes! @cwkraft Piracy of the printer? How much cheaper could it get? @f_vdbosch Shipping large items from US to EU via tracked carrier is laughably expensive, unfortunately. @Michael_Aubry I would give it a shot! Shoot me an email using link on https://t.co/Qg6uWmO8r1 and let's talk! Twitterverse! What are your thoughts on Glowforge? Do you buy the whole "cloud lets us save money on hardware!" pitch? @facelessloser It works great as long as you don't intend to take it apart. @RealMarkyB I'm not sure... Ghosts? The singer Meatloaf? How can I NOT watch this? https://t.co/uXg9Kl8EjC @TimothySCarter Oh yes. Very regrettable. @FletchWazzle It does some things very well, like chicken! Shooting a cameo with Alyson and making Super Wings with the Nuwave Oven. New recipe I've been working on. https://t.co/CwfP5fgQ6v @Michael_Aubry That could be worth a try! We've used the 123D App a lot before. @givezerofx Ha. With a CorelDraw plug-in. @planet_protect Neither :) So... Autodesk Inventor or Solidworks? @PackerBackerSTL Funny. He's like the human version of Grumpy Cat. "The stories are true, all of them" sends shivers down your spine because Han Solo himself is affirming your childhood for you. @timseppala @danielwcooper @JohnLegere @engadget Oh yes I comment on there from time to time! @JonnBlanchard The 3,157 Android TV boxes is diluting things just fine I would say. @JonnBlanchard Good point. Though on 2nd thought, after Nokia, neither of these are likely. @digitalhack @eevblog Yes because I will yank (pun intended) out the ULA! @TheWinterOfBen Data is a Halloween costume suggested to me a lot, but I'm more of a TOS fan. @shadelegend333 True! But it would make a lot of sense, like Disney buying Marvel to sell toys for girls AND boys. @shadelegend333 Haha maybe. Small companies buying bigger ones certainly happens too... for some reason. @uccreepshow And Nintendo online is the width of the known universe behind Xbox. BUT has the best IP. Xbox One is pretty far behind PS4. Wonder if MS has considered the "nuclear option" of buying Nintendo? @blkdog7 @SFGameroomExpo Feels like we shot that a lifetime ago! @abitofcode Hm I didn't test that but I should. @alfuture @eevblog We roll in different ways. I do take many other things apart first without turning on BTW. Svengoolie auctioning off the last NIB America's Most Haunted for 16k proceeds going to fight juvenile diabetes. http://t.co/eIDOt0qrle Pinball Life Explosion! Not even super packed yet. http://t.co/WE5h9LqKd5 P3 has a one handed mode for accessibility. They are doing a one handed tournament today as well. Cool stuff! http://t.co/EYdZTSjtNm @sonicase Right but why should that be my job? They designed the thing with holes! @mshine5 I have one I've done mods too. @Atomizer_Zero Isn't that a game or something? Saw some videos on the YouTubes. A garage band is playing next door. I can't believe they have the audacity to be so loud. @adamnaser Death by a thousand paper cuts! @amoose136 And for decades people stored ketchup bottles upside-down in fridges. There's no reason they can print a pattern! All surge protectors come with paper of some kind. Why not include a paper pattern for the mounting holes? Argh! http://t.co/cVciv4u8m4 @Dead_Flip @marcs_tweet Talk to Terry at Pinball Life. He loves building things he can sell! @Dead_Flip @marcs_tweet How about a leg bolt adapter where you can stick in a long rod and adjust it without going under machine? Finally watched my Fury Road 3D Blu Ray, and was inspired to finish smashing my old chipboard TV stand. With a rock. @marcs_tweet @Dead_Flip "Can be done" and "Can be done without drastically increasing price" are 2 entirely different things. @Dead_Flip Rumor is Hobbit has an IC on the PF and it can prompt you what legs to adjust. It's time to CNC cut office furniture and listen to Meatloaf. And I'm all out of... wait, there IS gum! @Sonikku_a As long as I'm not milking cats while wearing a metal diaper I'm fine with that. Since my YouTube viewing is a topic today, I'd say my #1 never-miss channel is @redlettermedia and yes, Wisconsin bias is part of that. @DualC0RE1 @Barnacules @MetalJesusRocks @AlphaOmegaSin I've watched some of his videos but he's a bit too enraged for me. He's always mad. @Barnacules @MetalJesusRocks Haha yes on occasion. And I do enjoy Metal's channel. "Junk mail that looks official" should be stopped. If super-skeptical me looks twice, an old person would be easily fooled. @StartupLJackson @LnghrnEngineer And yet my mail-order cremation idea http://t.co/pCMniNt4pG is still available! Oh crap. I hope that chicken was at least close to properly cooked. @fraganator303 If you want to make a 500k game and get 2 million, make a 500k game and pocket rest as profit from sales. Duh. Kickstarter needs to tweak their API so one year is automatically added to whatever someone enters as "Estimated Delivery Date" @TheJonesCode Yup, I have seen that movie. For some reason. Starring Interstellar Mud Man, Alias and Stone Romancer. A shocking moment today, as I suddenly realized I have indeed seen the movie "Ghosts of Girlfriends Past". Why, I can't recall... @Sonikku_a Eh..... I preferred Intersteller, despite it not using hexadecimal as a plot point. @KnuxKitsune No... it isn't even that. I must say the Martian is one of the best space movies with Matt Damon and Jessica Chastain that I have ever seen! Netflix "We just added a movie you might like" = "We just added a movie that is under 5 years old" @Zittware Be sure to wear a goatee! Weird. Does having a blank line before "else {" cause it not to compile correctly? @pdp7 Yes. Going to lunch now. The tower formerly known as Sears. Now owned by Bruce Willis. http://t.co/fk77xqyCWY @Zittware Oh yeah... Good point. You're coming up this year right? Just got into Chicago from St Louis. Never noticed this giant building before. Neat. http://t.co/FeW19LeS21 @zyla_j @stampylongnose I was on a flight. What is the idea? @LnghrnEngineer Hey! It was in an ESD bag :) @eevblog You have the most amazing dumpster! Best thing I ever found was a kitchen table (that I still use:) @cwkraft The @kickstarter said it would be out in 2016, so maybe I can play it by 2035. We should go back to the moon. Inflation adjusted Apollo program was $136 billion - a drop in a bucket with current budgets. #VOTEHECK Scram, clouds. I want to see the Super Blood Harvest Moon, voted "Astronomical Event That Most Sounds Like a Gameboy Advance Title" Snake? Come in, Snake. Snake? SNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKE!!!!!! http://t.co/cAawHGrK7d The @makerfaire I am at is #milwaukee @mtylerryan @frictionalgames I LOVE useless environmental machinery, actually, so I would never heckle up. Also, always examine ceilings. Think I can sniff the big twist in SOMA a mile away, still one hell of a ride from @frictionalgames @AndrewBean90 It also gives morning radio DJ's something to talk about when it's not Reality TV season. Tired of *every* day being "National Something Day"... but hearing cheesy "I Love You Period" on radio for Punctuation Day kinda worth it. @cr88192 Road House. Road House was the better movie (when comparing ANY two movies, even if one or both isn't Road House) Restored 16mm print of Manos? Available. http://t.co/a40BFWcPgw Original cuts of Star Wars? Lost! @RealYouMarcus That is the dream of all 3D print users. Not sure if it's ever been a practical solution. Hm. Looks like my server needs a dark, gritty reboot. Movie idea: Guy goes back in time, relieves middle school with the knowledge of an adult. Big 2: Little. Or 40 Going on 14. Never fails the second you throw / give something away you end up needing it. Why can't it become useful during 2 years it sits in a corner? Kids are evolving into super tall giants. Medicine? Selective breeding? At some point NYC is gonna have to remodel their subway tunnels. @Mad_Bike_Life Leg warmers? You do release that movie came out WELL past the 80s? (1996) Yahoo, got the bootloader working! I would do a Space Jam dance, if I knew how :( @Mad_Bike_Life @FozzTexx No, one MCU programming another. I spent entirely too young yesterday, on a nice sunny Saturday, programming bootloaders. I guess that's why I am who I am... @hackaday @element14 Sweet design! Love the shape. @ultramagnus_tcv I've never seen that movie. Isn't it controversial because it contains a "happy slave" character? @mjg59 Oh I see lowercase Gb. Good catch. Maybe you collect 8 of them? Bytes and Bits should have started with different letters. @WATRacingdotcom Pitch it as "Iron Man in WW2".... Ka-ching! @wjsteele @ParallaxKen @ohsummit @ParallaxInc You'd need the extra power just to lift the source of the extra power. Diminishing returns... @Ihnatko Van Helsing and League of Extraordinary Gentlemen getting new versions. I'd love a Doc Savage film, Shane Black might do it. Mary Poppins 2? Disney, if you're going to remake everything you've ever done, do Rocketeer but set it in WW2 not Hollywood. @CurtosNoir What makes it impressive, besides file dialog that isn't ancient? @EthanBB Hm that alone might be worth taking the subscription plunge. @EthanBB In all programs? AI, Premiere, Photoshop, After Effects? (the ones I care about bugger the rest) "Old view" is a pain when opening off network drives, OneDrive, Google Drive... you know, anything but a local disk. I have CS5. It uses ancient file dialog. Does CC have the normal, expanding folder view? http://t.co/PRkf7mFbO4 Anyone use Creative Cloud on PC? I have a question for you! @SomeBitterDude @Konami Casual gamers are fickle. They aren't long term customers, else WiiU would be a smashing success. @ParallaxKen @ohsummit @ParallaxInc Looks like you're building a Tesla! @scarce_sense @Konami Metal Gear Solid V??? It's awesome, but probably a Bioshock Infinite situation where long development killed them. Sad that @konami is giving up AAA for mobile, which isn't the future of gaming, just like cow-clicking "social" wasn't. History - study it. I keep checking https://t.co/IGmEO0EFlg waiting for their inevitable Metal Gear video of attaching balloons to strangers in public. @droiditup @IStandWithAhmed I'm sure he'll be invited to much more interesting places than my shop! @stevenapex @tigheklory @darkcat1 @ramair1997 I thought it was pretty good, mostly because nobody was painted in a positive light. @darkcat1 @tigheklory @ramair1997 Apple INVENTED lawn mowing. Didn't you hear? iMow. "You'll never look at grass the same way again" @tigheklory @darkcat1 @ramair1997 Plus we need The Chronicles of Steve Jobs: Origins Reloaded so we know how he grew up. @darkcat1 @ramair1997 I worked at a theater summer that came out. Jumanji wasn't even that successful. @ramair1997 Probably same reason we need 3 Spider-Man reboots in 10 year's time. @NolanBushnell Good point but that statistic probably doesn't work outside of America. @Mad_Bike_Life Vines or it didn't happen! This is what I need. Plated Flex PCB that ports out to something that can be soldered. http://t.co/7slVknlxlJ Looking for a supplier for short runs (under 100 pcs) of thin-flex PCB. Anybody have any leads? @MyByteAblaze I don't know what that it? Dear Chicago Bears: You can't win a game simply with a deluge of penalty flags. Good day to clean my laser. @Kitatus_Studios It's just missing an awesome, cheesy song like "Snake Eater" If Rambo 3 meets Red Dead Redemption sounds like your dream game, by all means pick up Metal Gear Solid 5! Colored Google mic logo. I keep thinking it's improperly aligned RGB or badly synced composite video. Annoying. http://t.co/xkdHxB1u9S Twitter!

Kind of lame to be coding Labor Day weekend, but soon Spooky Pinball will expand thanks to everyone's hard work. http://t.co/qSkpBhWO8b @Veronica You don't tell a new employee all your life tragedies while training them on the first day? Thought that was normal! @Prog98 Or: What killed the dinosaurs? GLOBAL WARMING! Today at shop we're discussing stupid puns Batman &amp; Robin's Mr. Freeze would have said had he been a heat-based villain. Suggestions? @TheJonesCode Oh that's right. Keep forgetting about that. @ramair1997 Kind of tired of super heroes. @cwkraft @LnghrnEngineer I work on PC all day long. It's good to take a break from screens and keyboards. @cwkraft @LnghrnEngineer You'll also be horrified to know I'm buying Fallout 4 for console! @goo3r "It was missing off the shelf, yet I could still feel it..." "Phantom Pain" must be doing pretty well. Was sold out both places I tried to find it last night. Know those movies like Valentine's Day and New Year's Eve? Should do Labor Day, where all the girlfriends have babies. I'm a genius. @SleepyDaddy781 Yeah I bought a couple. Had to! How far does 100k go in a town's budget? Better than 0k I guess! @craigjameson Yup, I just bought the HD Season 5 off Amazon. Cheaper, easier, and using an app my TV already has. @whoisdavidlewis GPS is only accurate to 9 meters or so. Not sure if that would be good enough to find a spot in the sand. Thought of an HBO Now slogan to help compete with Netflix: "Hey, We Have Movies That Are Newer Than 10 Years Old!" @EpicWolverine Oh that's awesome. And yes, I believe that's the direction desktop computers should be going in if they don't wanna die. @whoisdavidlewis Really hate to say this but couldn't that be accomplished with sticks? Dignity of Team Spooky is intact we both got Hole in One on our own game in Pin Golf Tourney http://t.co/sNvjrvOMFf Mad Rollin Tourney 2015.

Non-rage YouTubers are rare. @eri_smiles If you email me I've got a PDF version. http://t.co/m7XwqM70pL I suspect YouTubers will continue ranting and raging about Konami right up until Tuesday.#imissjapanesegames @YouTubeGaming is a service that simply filters out the 4% of YouTube that isn't gaming-related and puts it on a new homepage. @gothickitty1993 Yo. @lab317 Oh good lord. How could they even make these longer? Slow motion? More dishwashing? Include Peter Jackson's vacation videos? I really feared the worst with this week-old meat, 5-day-old bread sandwich. But it's really no worse than one from a gas station. #goPepper @eevblog I have the same problem with my giant Irish forehead. @ramair1997 What amazed me was every new release - no matter how terrible - was always sold out first weekend. People watch anything new. @ramair1997 Are there enough new release movies on HBO to make it worthwhile? Netflix is only really good for TV or ancient movies. The fatal flaw of HBO Now - and why so many cancel after free trial - is thinking it takes 1 year to watch 10 hours of content. #GoTadapter @Chewbode No, put them in a bin and give them to visitors / take to shows as "relics" Now they're making recycled Styrofoam out of dalmatian puppies! Nooooooooooooooo! http://t.co/4BsdQS7Fn7 @woody24 Price difference. @thisoldeconsole Frame rate and loaf time differences would be different enough you'd be out of sync quickly. You can experience Digital IMAX at home! Simply sit 1 foot from your TV (or close enough to see the pixels) and rip a $5 bill in half. Luke in new Star Wars trailer: "You have that power, too"... I secretly really hope he's saying that to an old, grizzled Jar Jar Binks. Ashley Madison info dump reveals 90% of their users to be men. In other words, just like every other online dating site. @astro_kjell @Veronica @NASAJPL Hope he's learning how to avoid getting stuck on planets. Seems to be his curse. @Slot1Gamer No. The sticker seems to be suggesting you recycle it though. @soynerdito I highly doubt they would know or care. Just noticed this Culver's has a transistor address. I'm jealous. http://t.co/kKqZ294c9L Disney seems to be making same mistake Atari did with Pac-Man: making more Star Wars, Marvel and Pixar movies than there are moviegovers. @mtylerryan Was actually thinking might be cool to improve the Virtual Boy. @mtylerryan It was likely what we'd call now a vector CRT, drawing lines with the beam instead of a raster image. @mtylerryan No, I haven't. That was before PDP even, right? 1950's? http://t.co/rbxxsNFziC are back up. Weird how static websites aren't that important in this cloud, social media YouTube age... Great.

I LIKE how DP burns as it goes down your throat. Makes it feel like you drank something! @tigheklory 12 packs are insane, close to $5 now. I only buy it 24 packs on sale. @Sonikku_a It tastes like "nothing" now. Like having a Bud Light after a fine German ale. Here's all the market research you need #pepsi - soda sales are down because the price went way up. That's it. Simple. See also McDonald's. New #dietpepsi has no "crisp" feeling and tastes like a flat soda. Sales are down? They're going to go down even further. The month of August is like a drain at the end of summer, clogged with events that congeal into an indistinguishable mush. @TheJonesCode "It exists now only in my memory..." - Old woman from Titanic, also last line in The Road Warrior. @TheJonesCode ARGH!

Excited for Fantastic 4 to arrive so I never have to see its trailer with "jokes" about adjusting office chairs + Thing falling ever again. America's obsession with fast food now extends to pets, study finds. http://t.co/aquPznKMxi @IrregularShed Cool idea! MS could call it Notepad # I like how the Windows 10 calculator shows all versions of a number and can be limited to byte, word etc. But does it have an unsigned mode? @DCM_techsupport Oh yeah. Those movies have actually gotten better with time, strangely enough. If you movie title contains a colon ":" and ends with "tion" then you have made enough movies in the series and should just stop already. @ninerbackslash It wasn't sour yet, had the bland, pasty taste that meant it was about to. Also, some chucks stuck to side of glass. @thekevbot Probably just an SQL error. I'll take a look when I get a chance, not a top priority at moment. Don't know what bugs me more. The fact milk went bad after 3 weeks, or that I drank half a glass before noticing. (Yes I'm still on this) This code feature won't work after all. I lose the time I spent writing it + the time I spend removing it. Plus, drank sour milk by mistake. @cwkraft McMaster is always next day if item is in stock Illinois. @EnusifyKaylie Search for "windows 10 force update" it seems there is a queue.

Bringing gizmos. @ILpinballclub Best scrap PSU ever was on Zip drives. Exactly 5 volts and beefy amps. @f5kn They were a popular computer in the UK. Impressively cheaply made. Like 1/3 cost of a Commodore. @eevblog @kickstarter Charge it using a Solar Roadway. @Phos_ I don't think so... I'm expecting New Horizons to send photos of Matt Damon next, as he is always finding himself stuck on planets. @JordanLord1 Almost always the ULA for video. It's socketed, that's the clue that it breaks a lot :) @SimonJustesen Four actually my tricked out one is off-camera. It even has a POWER switch! Latest Replicator mod: Screw adjust Z limit switch.

Really. Because that worked so well for Terminator. @TheRobotStew There will be an element 14 booth stop on by! @Zittware Prime is worth it. Just not those Prime Day "deals" @geekbuilders "Genysis" didn't bomb hard enough. Selective sequels is the new black! Fox shuts down Aliens fan-fiction http://t.co/CfaZxe04AZ probably since they're making their own #alien5 @TheRobotStew Yes. I was there last year too. @benheck Well, it makes sense if you need to clear out your warehouses. People use Amazon to buy whatever they want whenever they want it. Cramming stuff nobody wants into a single rushed #PrimeDay makes no sense @KustmKontrllerz It is very difficult with the silkscreen circuit. Same with PS4. @PinballWomenOtt @FunWithBonus Only animated theme pinball I would consider is Futurama. @SupersonicBrew The photos of Kiki Stockhammer load super slow! @retroamigo I'm shocked that prototype is so far along. Has anyone from Sony or Nintendo confirmed this to be real? Pluto flyby: Pics or it didn't happen! Darn slow ass space modems... @redqueen76 It at least knew what it was, unlike the two alternate universe seasons, what a slog! @redqueen76 I liked final season. It was very straightforward. "Fringe" would have been perfect as a 3 season show. Fox extending it because of "Firefly guilt" killed some of the storytelling flow. @ClaimingBaggage http://t.co/btXs2mXst7 Thanks for watching! Listening to Castlevania soundtracks and learning how to train my AVR Dragon. Typical Friday. @MakerBotSupport I can't DM you unless you follow me on Twitter.

Uggg...... If you've registered an Ouya, you likely got the "Celebrate your INDIE-pendence this weekend!" email. Dumbest. Phrase. EVER. Spending the 4th writing Verilog. It's what George Washington would want me to do. Might grill tomorrow. @TheJonesCode Certainly not the worst. @BenComicGraphic I know T2 you aren't told who's good or bad, but didn't the marketing spoil it? Was a long time ago, can't recall... T2 is great but it's just a bigger budget, needlessly long remake of the first. Plus I really enjoy T3. I'm gonna watch the best Terminator movie ever tonight... The first one. @supergeekboy1 Yup, come rain or shine! @benheck Fun game though great to finally see true next gen titles and the worlds they allow. SPOILERS Not since the death of Lori in Walking Dead have I been so glad to see a character die, the Batmobile halfway through "Knight" Pandora on Android phone... Anyone else have it randomly start a lot? Kind of embarrassing in public. Or at appointments. Wait, Green Day gets its own Rock Band game but Meatloaf doesn't? What a cruel and twisted world. @SuperRetroid Just think how did cab drivers do their jobs even 10 years ago with a GPS in every pocket? Change of technology = good sci-fi @cwkraft A topic that is LESS RELEVANT than it was 30 years ago. Brilliant minds there. @PaintYourDragon Yup. And instead of sports alamanac he tries to buy Apple stock. (though 1998 would be better for that) If Ghostbusters can be remade, then Back To the Future should be next. Imagine a modern teen trying to operate in 1985? Seriously, make it! Should have called it "Batmobile: Arkham Knight" These open-collector NAND gates have been a thorn in my side far too long!

And pay the Iron Price!" http://t.co/yL1uZJUGCr @SempaiScuba That's why the sodas cost seven dollars :) There were parts in Jurassic World where you could tell a really good movie was trying to claw its way out of the mediocre one they made. Alamo Drafthouse has Jurassic Park menu items such as VelociWRAPtor. "You made wraptors?" http://t.co/NbAsUhs1dC @Mad_Bike_Life Behold... The Amazing Brownie! It still exists! http://t.co/ohnZa4pbzW @HavocDEV There will be a booth we will be at during certain times. Now I'm in Austin for the Freescale Technology Forum. And ribs. Now I'm a trading card! Cool! http://t.co/7DsWk5JYZN Designer Dennis Nordman plays the Lucy Lightspeed P3 game he designed. http://t.co/DrVO4qr0dt @rvnknight Yeah its a binary planetary system actually, which many think Earth Moon is too. http://t.co/1aIk3e5ei0 Good to know there's still some wonder and mystery left in the world... Er solar system! I've been at the Southern Fried Expo for a day now, have only played 1 game of pinball. That's always how it goes :( Saw Billy Mitchell in hotel lobby. Will have to obtain some more of his hot sauce if he brought it! On my way to Southern Fried Game Expo in Atlanta. Will be giving a few talks, bringing mini pinball machine from show. @SaintNicster @jjhikes Good point. The non-Apple people will get HBO Now, binge "Thrones" and then cancel after a month. @cwkraft Different apps and logins for every channel? Ugg..... @jjhikes Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, HBO Now, Starz, it's piling up quickly and they're hogging content. $10 a "channel" adds up. Internet + ala carte will eventually cost just as much as cable does now. See how right I am in about 5 years. @ninerbackslash @Fallout Love the game, not interested in doing something 9 million others have. @tigheklory @TheJonesCode 1080i is not *really* 60 FPS rather 60 fields per second. The time dilation between fields would be awful in VR. @TheJonesCode @tigheklory "I was on Pee-Wee's Playhouse?" @tigheklory @TheJonesCode It's not a prediction, it's math. It simply won't work at anything close to what we consider a modern fidelity. @tigheklory @TheJonesCode Unless it's a game that looks like Star Fox 1993. @tigheklory @TheJonesCode Morpheus won't work. If PS4 can barely do 1080 @ FPS it surely can't do 1080 X 2 @ 60 FPS @TheJonesCode @LnghrnEngineer @BattlefrontEA OK I'll admit that looks cool even though I am beyond sick of Star Wars "Chewie... We're OLD!" @TheJonesCode @Fallout Hey I'll play other games! Will probably buy Batman. But none shall compare to the greatness of FALLOUT! @HaysiNoob @KEEMSTARx Still boggles my mind why people are so obsessed with controller implants. My take on E3: "Oh, @Fallout 4 is coming? Well I don't care about any of this other stuff, then..." I will be at the SFGE http://t.co/KLsDekXT1n this weekend in Atlanta (home of an even bigger Delta hub!) Check out my mini Pinball Machine! @eevblog Slashdot used to be a site crushing affair. Social media spreads traffic out nowadays. I barely have use for my website. @MicroHex Aren't they selling one in a deluxe edition? @woody24 Going to buy for PS4 to give that dusty box under my TV something to do with its life. Fallout 4 arrives this November? YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES! @cwkraft Dark, gritty reboot of Barney the Dinosaur? @cwkraft Too old. But anything from early 90s a 10 year old at the time would have liked yes. Power Rangers reboot already bring made. Jurassic World making mega bucks off 30-somethings nostalgia. If Robin Williams were still alive Hook 2 would be greenlit tomorrow. http://t.co/zuJuMql0ng Game #2 is based on Rob Zombie https://t.co/veB1eCoqUw with art by Alex Horley http://t.co/K9zNz3SEy0 "World" trailers looked very "meh" especially Ron Howard's daughters acting. But of course, only nostalgia matters nowadays. We're doing "over and under" bets this summer on movie opening weekends. Think Max is gonna lose guessing Jurassic World under 90mil. @eddiezarick @NinjaFlex3D It's kind of stringy at layer transitions, so not sure how smooth an inner edge might be. Been enjoying @NinjaFlex3D filament, though I like the rubberize grip of it more than the fact it flexes. Ed Robertson of Barenaked Ladies is an AMH customer, and he performed wearing the Spooky T-shirt on stage last night! http://t.co/osldTCnB4g Not sure why they put ham in the candles but who am I to judge? http://t.co/pTAAB39PL4 @SupersonicBrew Yeah that's the one they played. Don't believe I've ever heard ZZ Top in a wedding reception before. Kudos to my friend for that innovation. @KDStudios It'll be Apple or Google pay controlled over USB port. Much easier than coin mechs. The only reason airports don't charge you for charging devices is because they haven't figured out how to yet. USB C maybe? Google gets flight data from emails. So why can't Calendar auto-select the time zone I'll be in when I set events during date range of trip? @SupersonicBrew Sorry, flying down, not sure I can bring any. @DarkSamus79 Nope, gonna play Fallout on my giant TV, sitting on my couch. I'm not 100% PC Gaming Master Race. @tigheklory @onecircuit @krikzz @LnghrnEngineer I'm sure Intel wants to diversify as ARM continues to eat up market share. #fallout4 So when does it come out? This year? Please? Thank god we've *finally* left the last gen behind. @cwkraft YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!! @5Beans6 Nice!

The greatest pinball machine about ghost hunting TV shows ever made is now updated to v20! http://t.co/XyXQfpord0 Download and enjoy! @cwkraft BTW during your surgery did doctor say "Hope this isn't CHRIS' blood?" Because if he didn't, that's a wasted opportunity. @cwkraft if (itsAmoviePeopleHaveHeardOf == true) { remake = GREENLIGHT; } RT @EricJon: @benheck the eternal Bill Paxton http://t.co/F7BPGZIUwv @1111gordon @Mad_Bike_Life She's Patrick Swayze?

Maybe replace the arms with aluminum milled pieces. @Jfonts_ It has a Statistics screen you can look at @tigheklory Sausage biscuit for 1.06 can use the change in my cup holder! @LnghrnEngineer Wow that girlfriend is a real dog! @tigheklory McD problem is they are as expensive now as better chains, so why goto McDonalds? Breakfast is good though. @Kitatus_Studios Imagine a theater with toilets IN the seats. Trillionaires. @cwkraft According to a poll something like 80% of people would pay $20 to stream new releases at home @letzdewit Same thing killing McDonald's and there's no answer. @cwkraft Both if your examples invoice The Internet. Streaming! Movie theaters are in the same death spiral as postage stamps. Keep raising the price to offset weak demand, which in turn weakens it more. @eevblog Replicator 1 and 2 were their best machines. They should have just kept making those. This Memorial Weekend, remember Pogs. The Amiibos of 1995. "Schwarzenegger Terminated by Minions" - guarantee you'll see this headline Monday, July 13th. @ProfessorKelp We talked about that once but I've heard it's not as straightforward as just attaching a CAN bus. @Mad_Bike_Life Has it tried to make you push dogs through any doors? @Mad_Bike_Life I have the same problem with Queen. @ILpinballclub @GameroomJunkies I am completely confused as to what it is I should do... I've had same keyboard for 15 years. Scale of 1-10, how crazy is it to buy lot of 10 more NIB off eBay? Just in case? @Bensonix Shake Break maybe? At $9500 more than base model, Golden Apple Watch would need to contain almost half a pound of gold. I kind of doubt that it does... @Dunnie88x Yes it has all the same functions as a normal controller, but you have to use it differently. @TheMicMike That's pretty ironic considering I have about 4 Windows machines as daily drivers :) Phrase "non-stop action" is applied to a lot of movies, Mad Max Fury Road is the closest it's ever been to being true. Maybe 98% action. Reserved theater seating sounds great on paper... Until you have a group of 10 friends paying separately and wanting to sit together. @byllc I'm actually not there this year! Kinda burned out on travel this spring. But will be at the Detroit one. if (costOfBabySitter &gt; kidsUnder6getInFree) { ParentsBringKidsToRatedRmovie = true;  }           //hope this doesn't happen at Max Max today Simpsons: Why would Harry Shearer walk away from 14 million? Hm, maybe because @ 250k+ per episode for 25 seasons he's got enough money? @givezerofx @kickstarter I'm sure that will occur. Konami probably gonna give up on games and just build gambling machines. @givezerofx @kickstarter A modern Metal Gear as we know it would cost a lot more than a sidescroller. 22 month wait, least it's realistic BACKED! Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night on @Kickstarter http://t.co/bEyVmCQ09c @JWelham95 At least they sound real, unlike UNOBTAINIUM. @JWelham95 You're getting your fake elements confused it's vibranium (Captain America's sheild) not adamantium (Wolverine) Also @ 35k feet nobody could breathe, and dropping a city from that height would never achieve anywhere near an asteroids velocity. Avengers 2 Hulkbuster satellite - wouldn't he'd need at least 8 of them to cover Earth? (based off # of GPS / 3) @tigheklory @bad_robot @HamillHimself And now Tom Hardy stars in 15 movies per year. @tigheklory @HamillHimself @NathanHamill @chelseahamill I'm sure the young girl is Leias daughter or something. @keith_developer @EZ_Robot @InMoov We plan them about 4 months ahead of time, film them 2-3 weeks ahead of time. @JurvaVehasmaa Aside from cleaning, maybe 8 hours? Think the stepper drivers need better cooling though. #moarmods Replicator 1 made it to 1000 service hours so we're having a birthday cake to celebrate. http://t.co/WwKiDAWUAL #maythe4th a day when geeks celebrate a film franchise that hasn't had a good installment in THIRTY TWO YEARS. Hope that changes soon. @ParallaxInc Awesome labels! I wonder if the Propeller could replace PIA with some very well written assembly? @Mad_Bike_Life Oh man I remember that one. "Action Designing" scene. @tigheklory @J41m3 @unixgod And they pinned it on a Britney Spears Jessica Simpson hybrid monster! Avengers: Age of "Meh". Their movies are starting to all blur together. Maybe it's the 3D. @tanioklyce Thousands of milliseconds of research go into my Venn diagrams, thanks! :) Marvel is now casting for a new, younger Spider-Man!

Wonder how many negative reviews "Game of War" app gets when people realize it's not a Kate Upton bathtime simulator? #misleadingads @davecheney Not ironically dark enough! http://t.co/zP0HqNAdfa @BenComicGraphic Yeah ours is like... 2 blocks? @BenComicGraphic There is one "dangerously close" to our new shop. We call it "dangerously close lunch" YouTubers went from reviewing movies, then trailers, then teasers. Soon they'll be reviewing single frames, becoming art critics. In an age of YouTubers reviewing other YouTuber's reviews of movie trailer teasers, do companies even bother with market surveys anymore? If you could go back in time and tell your 8 year old self one thing, what would it be? Me? "Don't throw away ANY boxes!" @astormbrewing Or RETAKEN! Movie sequel names blow. So I'm actually quite pleased with Netflix calling their "Full House" reunion show "Fuller House" - it's the right kind of dumb. We live in a world where a sequel to a movie called "Now You See Me" is called "Now You See Me: The Second Act" @BrianBagnall1 How on earth did you know I just finished Season 1? So it doesn't keep it? Kind of inconsistent as-is. @tigheklory Waterboy was where he lost me. POS film. I liked Mr Deeds though. Mostly for the Winona Ryder sighting. Getting over cold. Now it only hurts when I laugh. Guess I'm watching an Adam Sandler movie tonight, then! @TinkersFriend1 Yeah I have one of those. Sort of helps, but I'm also going drugged-up route. @cwkraft Sounds like all the movies where computers have transparent screens despite that making no damn sense in functionality. Argh being sick sucks. What's best remedy for horrible sinus headache? @MatubSDMF Wanna say it was 2.5 amps at 7.4 volts. @MatubSDMF Think that's in Part 3.

We shot parts 2 and 3 back to back and it was quite the slog. @TimmyTechTV Those are some weird looking balls then! @Mad_Bike_Life @hisham_hm You'll have to watch to find out! (but the answer is yes) I gotta admit, Terminator Genysis looks like such a god-damn trainwreck of a film, I might just see it in theaters. @flibble666 I don't think anyone was looking at her hand :) Second day of Midwest Gaming Classic: go! @flibble666 Useful, thanks!

Thanks to everyone who helped make game a reality and our customers! @PackerBackerSTL I walked past it earlier. @Spawth Prints and builds what? Without fail I always show up at MGC pre-exhausted. Cuts out the middleman. Bride of Pinbot 2.0 has a camera on the tilt bob. Wonder if there's an Instant Replay when you do tilt? http://t.co/TzaZsfjJaJ MGC Spooky Booth noon tomorrow . Tournament battle for the last 2 available AMH games. See us for details. Just like Guitar Hero, I predict a "death by oversaturation" for superhero movie industry by 2019. @Spawth Gosh I'm pretty sure that's been done. SLR conversion kits. @jasondbrewer Oh yeah during out Theater of Magic game. I remember! Have fun with Arduino they are great! @tigheklory I'd like to do another movie someday but not sure when I'd have the time. Could make amazing props now. @tigheklory Just indie movies. But I've learned it's better to build things. 5 years ago I took my custom Bill Paxton Pinball machine to https://t.co/QVfpW7otiD and started down a crazy road I could barely imagine @BURNINGJUNK @eevblog I was so thrilled, in England, much of the numbering starts at zero! Train 0, Floor 0, etc. @BURNINGJUNK @eevblog What do you think is dumber, no 13th floor in hotels, or no 13th row in airplanes? @hackmodford Do you like it? @eevblog it's in case the hotel floor numbering gets a firmware update. @hackmodford Nice! 5 Nights @ Freddies could really work as a movie as long as it's straight "security guard haunted machines" no "YouTube = Real!" meta crap. @bighatdev @eevblog THEIR VERY SOULS. Seriously though take retail price divide by 3 that's what item costs. @crashrider Email me (link is on http://t.co/j1nza00nIw) @eevblog A 3D printer is a tool. Cheap tools suck. The time you waste will be greater than the money you save. @PortablesofDoom @MGC_gaming MGC is always quite the adventure! @epthegeek Ironically I was thinking the same thing! Oh Crap. That's $5 I gotta pay. If I were President I'd propose a $5 tax on misuse of the word "irony" The national debt would be paid off in minutes. BDUB naps working great to clean the laser! And we have a lot of them left. http://t.co/DFs5FMTUlE @Zengar Either that or Pinball Arcade would be cool. We'd gladly offer all files to get it done. Gonna give these Bdubs wet naps a shot at cleaning the laser. Could be a great life hack, if it works. http://t.co/042Ei0huBQ Disney! You're obsessed with live-action remakes? OK, then, give us a Guillermo del Toro "Atlantis: The Lost Empire" - that would ROCK! Server's been slow. Uptime 159 days? So since we moved to new shop. At least power is consistent. Yeah, time for a reboot. @TheAmpHour @MacroFab Hey! I took the photo of Parker on the right! I'm famous now hahahaha! @AndrewStaten Yes. That would be hella amazing. "I'm a DRAGON???" @Mad_Bike_Life Finally! Wait.. Oh no. It's April 1st! Damn. @RaymeCVinson I really, really really miss Sky-Mall. @VikingVR Yup... CHINA! It actually took me a few days to realize why "Mulan" is Disney's next live-action remake. Then it hit me. Can YOU guess why? @nickrbrewer Or that aliens DIDN'T colonize Earth in 2012. @nickrbrewer It's not a reboot THANK BABY JESUS! Google Maps Pac-Man game is cool. For a challenge, try UW Platteville https://t.co/7x8okhEErs Those darn mines made a mess of things! @hackmodford There will also always be anomalies at the polar center. Make sure that's either empty, or a solid section of plastic. I hope nobody is shocked by how much money Fast 7 is going to make this weekend. Series was huge BEFORE "dead actor bump" kicked in. @LanceMazmanian @NewPalaceFilms It's on display at SS Billiards in Minneapolis for all to enjoy! @Darren_D_Daley Sorry not yet. They built the controller in the same, hack-unfriendly way as PS3. Sites should have "Check Here If Under 60" and then won't send catalogs. I recycle them, but fear they just get turned into more catalogs. @hackmodford @Polar3D Yes polar can't actually do the center accurately. Will always be anomalies there. Place object on sides. @hackmodford @Polar3D It has a @Raspberry_Pi built in right? Is there local host software on your computer or tablet? @SiliconFarmer @element14 @WalkingDead_AMC Filming that episode... IT HAD TO BE DONE. You know that. @ILpinballclub It's so low now there's no point in updating site. America's Most Haunted almost sold out. If you're on the fence, jump off it quick.

John with the Star Trek Mirror Universe game! http://t.co/PBcVdKWQ40 @CommodoreBlog Did a few of those back around 2009. @cwkraft Right. Karl Urban is wasted in the new movies, Spock and Uhura are boring. Arrived in Dallas. #startrek3 Bones needs as much screen time as Uhura. If not more @Dirty_Engineer It's coming we spaced the  episodes out. @richms @sparkfun I used a Fluke :) Cool coincidence! #startrek3 No more villains from another time period with giant ships seeking revenge for things that happened off camera. @baltch well yes we need something new. Everything now is nostalgia, references and reboots. I'm cautiously optimistic for #startrek3 written by Simon Pegg. I shall use my "bored airport time" today to discuss how to fix series. @jarrettv Wow their rep must really have fallen if they couldn't even get a Troopers 2 green light. @hackmodford @Polar3D Great I'm curious to hear more. @eevblog @UstreamTV Use dial-up @FrankDM_ Oh it has been discussed, you can believe that! @jarrettv No. What happened? @Mad_Bike_Life Don't forget "Sweet Home Slothabama" Clearance price on Apple TV's, new model coming in June, after Game of Thrones ends of course. Coincidence? No. @jaspruill27909 http://t.co/WzkKnJWRLX BYOS. Oh yeah.

All the best episodes have occurred since the 1999 version. @hackmodford $600? Good value for that price @hackmodford I haven't used one personally but was impressed with the quality. $800 @eevblog @chorltonheelies If you did, it will fill up your 640k of RAM. @chorltonheelies @eevblog "No one will ever need more than 25 full-TV-frames per second!" @retroamigo @lazygamereviews A channel so good, it almost makes me want to visit thrift stores... Almost. @eevblog It's those darn EuroVolts I bet... Have you ever watched Lazy Game Reviews?https://t.co/Czfqkaqpcy Great info and not angry / vulgar like most game-related channels.

I should ironically shred the catalogs into free packing material. Life hack! @cwkraft Back to The Future should be rebooted. A kid in 2015 would have no idea how to function in 1985 = comedy gold. @wetalkgames Eh, some things translate to Pinball, not sure that would. Visiting Spooky Pinball. Bunch more games going out the door! http://t.co/2xhvgdZBPh Gotta imagine a Five Nights At Freddie's movie can't be far off.

Trying to remove all political name predictions from my phone. But I remove "Bush" and it just goes "Washington"... Can't win. @flibble666 We're doing a Dreamcast portable.

You mean that ancient episode we did? @DRLuLu86 Cool, thanks for watching! @DRLuLu86 I'm not nearly famous enough to have any impersonate me online :) How to watch Game of Thrones on the big screen if you don't have cable. http://t.co/uQRt5A1J43 @wetalkgames A pale comparison to the Atari 2600 but with better text support. Uncharted 4 part pushed back? This is the slowest starting console generation ever, and I've seen them all! Marvel took risks and earned their shared universe. All other studios are creating shared universes to reduce risk #youredoingitbackwards Damon Lindelof tells wife "I was in the produce aisle, and then..." Her: "What happened next?" Him: "What do YOU think happened next?" @cwkraft Having multiple boxes and remotes is also annoying. I love my Smart TV. @cwkraft I only use iTunes to rent movies to watch on planes. Plugging boxes into my Smart TV is going backwards. @cwkraft No, I am good. How many of you have Apple TV, the only way for cord-cutters to watch Game of Thrones on a TV as it airs? (hooking PC to TV doesn't count) Apple TV's advertising budget went from $0/year to "huge bribe paid to #HBONow" I don't want to watch GoT on my iPad for crying out loud. I must say, it was a bold choice for Zack Synder to cast Rob Zombie as Aquaman. http://t.co/yNegydSqho @Capn_Fox From a girl scout. @cwkraft @Beaster1174 Tell you what, bring a blender and we can give it a try at Midwest RepRap festival.

Thanks for reminding me why I never watch network TV anymore. @Molex1701 District One X Chappie/Aliens 5 nicely demonstrates the trick of setting up your next film before your current one bombs, thus allowing perpetual work.

Are they sorting by weight now? @msirkin @FozzTexx Oh thanks. I couldn't remember what other flavors there were. You know, let's be honest here: Why do Girl Scouts even bother to make any cookie flavor beside Thin Mints? What a waste. @Techblogogy Yes, back when my hair was redder and he was less wrinkly. @neoalexb I'll never have one of those! Ginger pride! @eevblog @YouTube Probably means "100% ready to be watched in some form" They say time heals all wounds. In my case, age has bleached out my red hair to mostly blonde like my siblings. I'm fine with that. @mattjbaldo @joystiq Yes. I don't understand how it works. They post gaming news through Engadget? @joystiq Is the Phantom pain from a game's legs being chopped out from under it, having to also work on last-gen console? Dear "the media": If a human is piloting it, no matter how remotely, it's not a drone. Drone implies autonomy. @rmccle ...and screenwriters. @CharmedLabs Yes it worked quite well, thanks for creating such a cool project! @docdork They most certainly built the core drilling ship out of it. Wait a minute... that precious metal in "Avatar"... they were TOTALLY able to obtain it! So why wasn't it called "Obtainium"? #plotholes The mad dash to create "Apple/Android/Samsung Pay" isn't for your convenience or security - it's for the % they get off the top. @teemark Damn! Well I re-clogged it with some House of Card 4k streaming haha! @tigheklory It was decent. Michael Keaton and Gary Oldman always good to see. It's national House of Cards Binge Day, and YouTube barely works. Paid prioritization in action? Anybody else have hella slow Net today? @AmznMovieRevws @ArcadeHunters Have to agree that the last sentence aligned with my thoughts while watching. @gmcintire Texas Pinball Festival last weekend of March. Now that's what I like to see - finished debug list for America's Most Haunted. See ya'll in Dallas! http://t.co/AFZ5uzavLS @tigheklory Oh BTW, in good movies the hero screams the villain's name. In bad movies, the villain screams the hero's name. True fact. @tigheklory KHAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! KHAAAAAAANNNNNNN!!!!!! @uncleglen64 "Are you out of your Vulcan mind? No human can survive in there!" - Real Star Trek 2. @matphillips I converted mine to work as a USB serial terminal. They are around $100 on eBay. Millions upon millions were built. Leonard Nimoy is gone. And the Kardashians continue to spawn. There is no God. @cwkraft Well people said that wouldn't happen with computers either, but it did. @cwkraft Best quote I ever heard was "If you don't know what you'd do with a 3D printer, you don't need one" @cwkraft OK anyone who does print a lot of documents and doesn't need color should consider a laser printer. @cwkraft Everyone should own a laser printer. They are an excellent bang for your buck. @matphillips TRS 80 Model 100 @Everlark_heart @j_lawsbian90 What if they attach David O Russell (plausible as he once tried to make an Uncharted movie) Also, tabloids! Ever consider "J-Law" could also mean "Jude Law"? Yeah, I know. Mind blown. Tomb Raider movie reboot announced. Dump truck full of cash undoubtedly being driven towards Jennifer Lawrence's mansion. @tigheklory http://t.co/BHMQJZEU3a @cwkraft he seems like the sort of person who would have ten of them. The topic came up of "What IS an eccentric circle?" so I drew this. http://t.co/zkwdxb2yf0 Gordon Ramsey saying "I wouldn't feed that to my dog!" is a little disingenuous. I'm sure his dog eats better than 20% of Earth's population So is the #Oscars2015 plan to spread the awards evenly, so people keep watching having no clue what will win? Multitasking! I can play test code, watch the serial debugging, and watch Chopped on Netflix. http://t.co/uKzJnJufjB Oscar TV ratings: If the Superbowl or World Cup were as predictable, nobody would watch them either. Testing underway at Spooky Pinball East. "I sense it's really noisy in here!" http://t.co/8OLRsrnNfZ Also, difficult drawing a Pixel Art hipster without them looking like a homeless person. So I added a cup of coffee. Turns out it's really hard to draw ghost tipping over a cow without it looking like a rectal exam. @AndrewStaten You can eat White Castle while you watch Netflix, it's OK. Looking forward to House of Cards Season 3 where he tries to become President of Earth, and Season 4 running for Galactic Prime Minister. @tigheklory Only ate there once but liked it. Regional chains do well, it's the big guys falling down. @tyronerodriguez Yes you can goto the http://t.co/WukNmEaRU8 community to suggest one! @_s1500_ You mean to see if light is on? Most pins use visible spectrum optos so unnecessary. 20 years ago, fast food was "Good, fast AND cheap" Now it's none of those. My stock guidance? Sell. @cwkraft @LnghrnEngineer I'll add bioluminescence to list of things genetically added to the deer. @bo2bo2 On Atari 2600 that was the Starpath Supercharger, or you can use the Cuttlecart. There's also a Harmony cart you can try. @adamnaser Because he spent money? @AndrewStaten "Walking Dead, the #1 hit show where every episode is a bottle episode!" http://t.co/pLjTl7ZjA9 2015 will set a record for movie grosses. Though they're nearly boiling the frog with how many films people can possibly see. Walking Dead has to be the biggest hit, cheapest show ever made. Daylight, woods, talking... It's basically an indie film. @FTOTTEblog @backflipfilms He survived, but claims to have had a "wingover" the next morning. @kevinseccia @phredmund Tom Brady day? @LnghrnEngineer Zombie Richard Attenbourough! @isocube I have heard I appear in part of it, yes. Much like @Mad_Bike_Life kindly did I'm meeting new Spooky Pinball programmer today so I can train my replacement! @Legit_bacon That's awesome! @cwkraft Yes. I don't mind long movies if I'm watching them at home. @GryffDavid That could be fun! Maybe as a long-term, multi-part. A guy once built the Apollo Guidance computer from scratch. @cwkraft ARGH! NO! Why? Also, Batman V Superman will probably be 3 hours as well. #ValentinesDay thought: Do people really fall in love, or just run out of roommates? @supersat @jeriellsworth Probably CAN as used in Big Juicy Melons. New production company @backflipfilms doing the Blazing Challenge. Hope our new camera person survives. http://t.co/FKE4RYvAun @supersat @jeriellsworth Our system is actually more traditional that theirs. I'm excited to take a look at it. @wholeset Um... he he he... ahhh.... yeah ours has that feature. So I guess I am part of the problem, not solution :( @woody24 Guess you could sniff the data going to the displays and map that into a number. Or replace the score RAM with a MCU. @tigerthecat5 The watch should BE the phone, and not have a laughable battery life :) All consumer electronic advances right now are being hindered by the fact they must somehow attach to a smartphone. Boring! And as usual, flying East much easier and delay-free. Weird how that works. Getting ready to head home. Short trip out west, but fun. @cskenney Yeah I was shocked how long it took the HEX joke to land. @airwolf3d No way a helicopter could lift all those CRT monitors! @cskenney Glad I didn't completely blow it! To those who need to touch or hold something before believing it's real... Selfie stick. It... Exists... http://t.co/S01YEogWYj Golden Mousetrap Awards, backstage selfie. If you want to unfollow me for saying "selfie" I'll understand. http://t.co/7mFmSaJbwW @DJEmergency Haha no LA. I'm here at the UBM show in Anaheim. Doing a talk at noon. Looks pretty interesting! http://t.co/6CujAxhnTU Finally landed in Orange County. Flying into or out of Madison's airport is slowly becoming unbearable. Looks like I'm on another Madison flight of Jim Henson's Epic Babies. Guess that's better than a bunch of old folks. @dirtydave0221 Big phone = big battery! I considered the Nexus 6 right up until I heard what size it was. No one handed use = dealbreaker. @dirtydave0221 Love it so far. True test is travel, browsing web different cities, and doing cab driver's navigation job for him. @dirtydave0221 Ha! Not sure. Even with an extra battery, I would be lucky to get to my hotel with any charge left. @dirtydave0221 The 2011 Galaxy Nexus. Tomorrow will be my first time traveling with the Moto X Gen 2. Interested to see how it does compared to my previous Android phone. @JimmyTransistor Yes, I am now a ghost. Wooooooooo! Cast iron Meeples! The cost? Usual iron price. http://t.co/HRn10NY6de Looks like they are planning the big pour! They look like a bunch of firefighters. http://t.co/TXxd6r8Z5U Iron Pour at Sector 67. I am hoping for many sparks! http://t.co/issKsrByVN @b00gamonkey @C2CPinball Haha I think Chuck was shocked by my interview style! Here is a photo of a super cute baby goat I saw. Sorry it does not involve electronics. http://t.co/uhII8JIeOr New Horizons is exciting as we've never really seen Pluto. It's a large (dwarf?) reminder that there's still mystery out there. @tarfito That's an awfully big coin! Built in WiFi is cool. I expect the first New Horizons photos of Pluto to be of protesters with signs reading "We're Still A Planet, Dammit!" @Cephalization Acetone buy a can at hardware store. Brush it on. This August will mark the 20th anniversary of the Print Dialog box Microsoft  have yet to change. @b00gamonkey It was pretty fun! Imagine it sucks now with all the Marvel credit watchers. @b00gamonkey I worked at a movie box office once. Was amazed how many people decide what movie to see when they get to theater. @thestudcomic Film stuff is my hobby, I've heard of everything! @thestudcomic New one incoming! Because why let Exodus Gods &amp; Kings bombing stop them, right? @thestudcomic Commandments and Ben Hur both had prior silent film versions (same director for Commandments!) Almost all media now based off nostalgia. This creative black hole means in 20 years there will be nothing from now to be nostalgic about. @thestudcomic Sword &amp; sandal flicks were big too. "Bill Murray on the African Queen!" "About About Eve" starring Eddie Murphy, "Stallone &amp; The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" Imagine if the creative films from the 1980's had all been reboots of 30 year old movies instead (like everything now) I guarantee the Packers would not have done anything that stupid on 2nd and Goal had they made it to the Super Bowl. Tom Brady looks pretty deflated, sitting there on the sideline. At Spooky Pinball we decided to have an AC/DC halftime show. http://t.co/22Jj0PkZi8 What is up with all these sad, sappy commercials? What is The Dude doing in that couple's bedroom? Kristen Bell must be proud that Sloths are now mainstream enough to be in a Super Bowl ad. Time to watch some cool commercials with limited interruptions of millionaires throwing dead pigs at each other. @walltechOSHW @Ascii211 That's not entirely true. I'm also a lot more crude in real life. @PyramidHead76 Did Hackaday ever award the space prize? @joystiq closing sucks. Where do I get gaming news now? Some angry person swearing for half an hour on YouTube doing a Let's Play? Pretty cool stuff! https://t.co/n7SQLIqB3D "3D printing for circuits" will be The Next Big Thing, just wait. @thestudcomic @element14 I believe so! @PigInTheMudo @okaeIIy Thanks for watching! Music industry is rapidly collapsing into a Taylor Swift singularity. RT @MacroFab: First step to agile is prototype often: prototypes should be affordable, so we built a service to make it so. http://t.co/5PK… @Tweetn2You OK the movie part is a stretch I admit. The rest I feel is solid. I can't imagine many people spring for $$$ in flight Wifi. Note: This isn't something Amazon / airlines are doing. I'm suggesting it's something they SHOULD be doing. Shipping arrival is based off when you'll be back at home or work. Also Prime members can stream SD movies unlimited in flight. The Idea: Offer free WiFi to browse Amazon. Purchases earn "external" browsing time, Prime members get double minutes or free minutes. Hey Amazon / Airlines / Remnants of SkyMall, great idea incoming! Feel free to steal it. @epthegeek Friend wants sand molds for an upcoming iron pour at Sector67. @benheck Drat. It's coarse, of course. I hate sand. It's dry, and course, and not smooth like Natalie Portman. And it gets everywhere. http://t.co/CwhkB1KVms @MNeko My PC-7 still works after 26 years! I'm going to port this spreadsheet calculation to a Tandy PC-4 program because...  reasons! http://t.co/gEUhRdnGNS @RaymeCVinson Right. Plenty of stories to tell without rebooting. @RaymeCVinson Right. But same age means reboot. Ugggggghhhhhhhhhhh. @richardwadeuk Doesn't need to be a reboot. Could just be a young Indiana Jones (but not "kid young") @TimmyTechTV Eh, I'm more anti-Patriots if I had to make a choice. They win too much. @eevblog Of course they will. "It is their destiny" [and will of the shareholders] I'm OK with a recast Indiana Jones, but they need to go younger than Chris Pratt. Just like how Matt Damon was too old to play young Kirk. I can't care about Super Bowl. "Who will win? The team that won just last year, or the guys who've won multiple times in the last decade?" @Ihnatko My breaking point was "Paulie" getting turned into "Palin" - even presidential candidates now??? Goal: Do more "normal person" stuff and get to a point where Google Now isn't giving me time-to-work info on Sundays. @Ihnatko I use SwiftKey! Where is that option? I have friends named Michelle who aren't married to the president, it turns out. Autocorrect always suggesting politician's names came in handy exactly once (George Bush airport) and was annoying the 4579 other times. @TheQfilmcast "Happy birthday Paulie!" @tigheklory @blkdog7 I thought this was going to be a puppy photo or something! @SFGameroomExpo Gotta get Spooky Chuck down there too! @TheQfilmcast Space Jam only had 2.5 minutes that took place in space. @TheQfilmcast Rocky 4: The Movie That Was 100% Montage. @cwkraft Don't think airplane WiFi killed then so much as Amazon. @eevblog I don't care for the double tap to open notifications. Also Chrome tabs pile up quickly in App Drawer. @The_Engineer7 Naturally speaking OS is the next paradigm shift, and will make tapping screens look like apes with sticks. @bhockle No. Not when a Road House pinball remains unmade! @samfreeman05 Oh it's better than Vista no doubt. But mostly similar. Vista wasn't as bad as Apple's smear ads were good :) Windows 7 was Vista with a different name and people accepted it. Is that the plan with 10? 'Bout time they did universal apps! @eevblog Looks like the start of a solar Frick in roadway on Mars! @James___UK Eh, took a week off last 4th of July. @eevblog @tektronix The printed part is *technically* edible but I wouldn't suggest it. Think of the most obvious titles for a "Now You See Me" sequel. Easy right? Too bad, they're calling it "Now You See Me: The Second Act" @James___UK Decent looking failed prints I keep to give away to visitors and kids. Really the wasted time is biggest expense when print fail @PackerBackerSTL Packers are their own worst enemy. Sad. @James___UK I would like to make a grinder to recycle bad prints and ABS scrap. I know it's raining but can anybody hold onto the ball? Gotta be some sort of record for interceptions. @PackerBackerSTL Packers have caught more of the Sea hawks passes than their own! @PackerBackerSTL Seattle would be dangerous if they could hold onto the ball. Wen Heat Guns said "Screw it! Let's use the hottest tech support stock photo we can find!" http://t.co/VJaBn46GK4 @Dev_Enthusiast @Raspberry_Pi @beagleboardorg Beagle Bone is a beefier machine. @Dev_Enthusiast @Raspberry_Pi @beagleboardorg If it involves internet connection, video, lots of processing, yes. @C2CPinball Yahoo! The PF really tied the game together. @sebastienb Haven't used Tinker cad. @tigheklory @blkdog7 @jow_42 What horseshit, especially in a world where lite beer commercials claim "great taste ' @tigheklory @blkdog7 @jow_42 The only people who win in a class action lawsuit are the lawyers. @Jezez89 I play Titanfall once or twice a week on PC. @DrDavidWilkins Yes it truly is! @FadeFu Yeah, why would I spend 15 when I can get a Blu Ray for 20? Hollywood: Want people to buy VOD movies instead of just rent them? Then try making better movies! People pay more for quality, see Apple. @rrrebo Pretty cool! It also used ultrasonic along with that sensor bar that went on your TV. @mudads @gamespot Pinball has been on upswing since 2010, actually. Stern @ CES simply proved to new audience pins are still around :) Wonder how much of the PS4's success comes from its logical name? Versus 1 to 360 to One, Wii+U and "New" 3DS. Max, the new guy, being indoctrinated into the daily pinball break on Attack From Mars. http://t.co/cZHDb5usIb @LnghrnEngineer Could OCTOPROBER help with your beer brewing? @LnghrnEngineer http://t.co/0ru93nzNcl else can you probe an Octopus? @tigheklory @retroamigo Past a certain gauge I use my auto-strippers. @C2CPinball Spell WIKI, Tech and Psychic = Video Mode. EB every other ghost beat + other stuff. Thanks for the great review! @tigheklory Improved filament spooler for my SeeMeCNC Orion Delta printer. @LnghrnEngineer @PackerBackerSTL Careful Sean! Team Spooky is going to Dallas in March and we don't wanna get beat up... LIKE THEIR TEAM HA! @PackerBackerSTL Ha ha who cares? Cafe near shop, food is a 7 or 8, napkin structure for doodling is a 2. http://t.co/OiQxCHSBpK @PackerBackerSTL Thanks for the help! READY. PILOT. ONE. @isocube I prefer the sponge. This isn't my main iron. @GrumpyCatsMind @Veronica That's a very good idea I find phone calls very annoying. @iliketomakestuf Um, sure I guess? Email me. Spending Saturday fixing my Space Shuttle. Also, teaching Felix how to make single handed controllers. http://t.co/BDfWaHY7kp @isocube Sega did an X files pin in the 90s. They're fairly cheap if you can find one @isocube Just had a big "why X-Files is better than Fringe" discussion 2 days ago. So yes. I even liked the Mulder-less seasons, not bad. @isocube just had to install the new MB drivers. Where did you get your avatar? @antshockey Didn't realize that. Had slowly replaced parts on shop PC, CPU/MB were last to go! @PackerBackerSTL @LnghrnEngineer Puke green, toilet water green, baby puke yellow and urine - yup! Those are the Gameboy Colors all right! @xfatalxzero That was our backup plan, but since BD worked at an angle, we just left it in! Replaced CPU and MB. Planned to re-install Win 7, but it booted and just had to install MB drivers. Didn't realize that was possible. @denofgeek one of my favorite movie sites, until I try reading it on mobile. Can you think of other great sites with horrid mobile versions? @ILpinballclub Pretty sure that one's "Life imitates art" @MarkSheppard Right. If I have to stand next to a game and tell you how to play, I didn't do my job as a programmer / designer. @MarkSheppard We're going to set up the game and walk away :) We think that's the best demo. Spooky Pinball hits the road! http://t.co/Hko00sdpdO See "YA'LL" in March! @zqp2 The toxic chemicals freeze faster than high fructose corn syrup? Gotta throw some Mexican Pepsi in for a control test, too! @zqp2 Yeah I've still got Spray-Splosion froze to part of my rear window. @maurye You mean Star Trek: The Motionless Picture? @LinkToo @wholeset ...what a savings. @x @bowenkerins Thanks for your support! @benheck Much like how Star Fox is the best Star Wars game ever made. Galaxy Quest is on Netflix Streaming. If you haven't seen it, it's ironically one of the best Star Trek movies ever made. @collinchaffin Only 3 of 24 cans exploded! A net win for our fine city! Wisconsin! The only state where soda left in your car could explore from extreme heat OR cold! http://t.co/D1Q9aE4Eii @Shake_Well Plus Internet and you're back to $100 a month again. That was probably the master plan all along. @jandrade No way in Heck it's lower than Netflix. $20 / month wouldn't surprise me. @Shake_Well They can't go much higher than Netflix or Prime. Prime already has most legacy HBO shows (that could change) Prediction: Non-cable HBO Go will only be sold yearly, else everyone would subscribe for April and May only. How much would you pay? @internettubes I never finished GTA5. I'd assume half the planet worked on that, and the other half bought it :) @internettubes Think it was GTA4 where my controller went to sleep TWICE during the credits! @internettubes Is it THAT obvious I finished Far Cry 4? Great game BTW! But MAN the credits were long! "Who should we put in our game's credits?" "How about everybody in the entire worldwide company?" "Sure!" @GJamesBerigan Why? The mini pizza cooker was cool. Less volume of food would save shipping costs. @GJamesBerigan Hold on one of my 15 fax machines is getting a message... "Giant widescreen TV's filled with crappy channels and videoconferencing" - the only things Back to the Future 2 got right. @markwaring88 Next Friday I think? @misterbonnie That is so cool! Forgot to buy some at Maker Faire Detroit. Next time! @richthofen Glad you enjoyed it! Myself, Spooky Pinball and America's Most Haunted will be at the Texas Pinball Festival in March... ya'll! http://t.co/Hko00sdpdO @Veronica Vampire hunter. It is your destiny. @eagle5953 Ah yes. @EvinhaPT13 @tigheklory It does say one UK national was on board - crap! @TJConsoleRepair I don't yell, but when it's employee's fault 100% (not policy or beyond control) I certainly let them know I'm displeased. Ouch. I forgot that I turn into Gordon Ramsey when I get bad customer service. @eevblog I always ask people to bring examples of things they've soldered, and honestly inspect that more closely than their resume :) Forget this "sort of released" Seth Rogen movie. The much-better "Team America: World Police" is streaming on Netflix. Top. Gun. Actor! @eevblog There's a Chrome plugin called Batch Reply. You can download it from Chrome store. Makes responding kind of confusing though. @eevblog Are you getting a minion? @DarkSamus79 I want to see how bad the fifth one is but it's impossible to rent online, buy only. Also 96 minutes? Must be awful. @MarkRein These hacker scumbag losers are the real Grinches of Xmas, and they won't have a change of heart unfortunately. @bhockle I've been playing Far Cry 4 offline. Update is taking forever though, probably related. Since it is Christmas, I will sit home and play video games rather than reverse engineer differential signaling at my shop. @justsmellyallt1 Doesn't need a patent just lots of hand wiring and custom 3D parts. Maybe a kit? Person ahead of me in drive thru paid for my food "because of xmas" Bizarre So I paid for person behind me. Wonder how far that will combo? @ServiceComputer I use the modified one from Thingiverse. Works like a charm. Still have original nozzles after 900 hours of use. Left alone "The Interview" would have bombed. Ironically, by trying to stop it, the "hackers" have increased awareness a hundred-fold. @calemon it's the last visible cable! Not sure if I can snake it through and not hit the rumble motor, however. Getting a batch of single handed controllers packed for shipping! http://t.co/S7P2S9rV5q Printing small parts two at a time to use up the last bits of this spool efficiently. http://t.co/6OinCNhup2 @TheMorfeus SSR fairly cheap, and can be controlled with 5 volt logic. But yes, mechanical relay would still work. @redqueen76 Oh and I forgot - CATALOGS! At some point they spend more on catalogs than the profit from the ONE thing you bought ONCE. Also RE: "legitimate spam" I filter it all into a "B2B" folder, and sometimes miss things like Best Buy points and password confirmations. Getting tired of "legitimate spam" companies sending you lots of junk mail just because you ordered something from them once. Hotels too! @BrianBagnall1 Will be interesting to see what the Fan Edits can whittle it down to. I'm not against long movies just boring ones. @f5kn I'd counter with most links are far larger than your mouse pointer. Yeesh. Horrible weekend grosses for the latest barrage of sequels and remakes. Playing it "safe" clearly doesn't pay give us something new! @royterdw Sadly, with enough special effects and 3D the foreign markets let them get away with anything. Like Transformers. How do you all feel about radically different Mobile Versions of sites? Do we need them in an age of HD resolution phones with 6" screens? @8bitghost @Mad_Bike_Life It was always in the bathroom before :) @cwkraft Excellent point. There are some at the Woodman here I've never seen used, even before Thanksgiving. @sportscrazed2 I'm not a coffee drinker so no, haven't done anything. Many orders for Single Handed Controllers have come in. Orders since Nov 25th will be built after Christmas. Thanks for your patience! Guessing Marco Polo is Netflix's Game of Thrones? Worth watching? Are beach balls thrown in water? @ChrisSchodt @walltechOSHW @backchnnl The ISS will soon be neck deep in bottle openers and tiny plastic robots :) @tomsliwowski in real life she dated her Hobbit co-star in Lost so I guess she has a type! @solidvue Dump trucks full of cash will ensure that it won't. "They'll never make a movie from The Silmarillion!" - They stretched Hobbit into 3 films. So yes, by all means, they will. @Mad_Bike_Life Turns out Alyson's nose is merely a hologram! http://t.co/qjQvbBHL5E @bhockle Alyson says cabbage soup. We used the IR camera and her nose was very cold looking. WTF is Alyson doing in the break room? http://t.co/l3CQzn3r74 @sophistifunk There's enough overlap - it will happen! King Kong was also a good movie trapped in an overly long one. Is the 2-hour-long single movie fan edit of "The Hobbit" done yet, or is that more likely to come out after the Blu-Ray? @metallimyers @leolaporte Thanks! It was fun. @tomsliwowski I liked Firefly. Will never bother with Buffy though I'm sure it's good. @tomsliwowski I see that show is on Netflix. Worth watching then? At Spooky Pinball prepping a Christmas Code update of our original themed game. http://t.co/qvOhSxVrS6 @eevblog The color shape is a button? Maybe they should have made it look like one, instead of a logo for Organic Coffee Tampons. Robotics club stopped by shop. Never signed a laptop before! http://t.co/Gvy2ujhC2U @Jeffers727 All movies are orange and teal, they are complementary colors. New Mad Max looks amazing. Only concern I have is why did it need 2.5 years of post production? (it wrapped 2 years ago!) Discovered that a @fleetwoodmac Pandora station is only 70's music that doesn't get associated with Queen. EVERYTHING else does, bleh! @TimmyTechTV That's awesome! He looks like a ball player. Parks and Rec's....  in SPACE!!! All joking aside, loved this movie. See? I do like some movies, occasionally. http://t.co/hcSL1I1P89 @TimmyTechTV @Barnacules It's good to have bite-sized things you can build in an episode. I often go too large and scope with projects. @Cratylus79 A robot that draws on paper? @retroamigo With all of the updates on consoles and games these days, you will have to wait I'm afraid :) Been enjoying Far Cry 4 on PS4. And I have to admit, it does look "next gen". Maybe this gen is finally kicking into gear. @thijs4555 Auto-range of course! Far Cry 4 takes place in Kyrat, a fantasy realm where animals run TOWARDS the sound of gunfire. The old oscilloscope has become a Sith Lord! Gooooooooood...... http://t.co/qXG2rz7jUI Not much room to write. Has Post Office actually seen a book-long foreign address before? http://t.co/k6w1GIYcN6 @paramountpics Please round up as much of the Futurama creative crew you can and let them at least write Star Trek 3. Gotta hand it to Sony, this week's update for the PS4 only took a couple minutes to complete. @dougalshaw Very cool! I see he's making a new device, too! @sn33zing We needed a proper Future War trilogy of movies. A beginning, then "Salvation" and ending chapter with sending Kyle back in time. Shouldn't a new Terminator film appeal to fans of the series? Instead of making them think "This looks like the worst thing ever?" @f5kn Dell just announced a sale on 27" 4k so I'm kinda bummed. Still, text is almost too small for me as-is. Only thing I'm more sick of than movie reboots are "time travel reboots" - first Star Trek, then X-Men, now Terminator. Ugh... @KriLL3 Yes I have Samsungs at work and I'm excited to replace them with my older Dells because, well, they're better! @wholeset They still work fine! Going to use them in shop in place of $200 Best Buy cheapies. Can't recommend Dell monitors enough. Got new pair of 27", and old 24" pair going on my shop PC. Seven years strong! http://t.co/ZAC4kyCHsr Nice! My Moto X is downloading Android 5.0 Lollipop. Soon I can do whatever that update is all about, or something. @tigheklory @lamelama22 Riiiight. And he's NOT playing Khan... @adamnaser Nice one! Need a laugh? http://t.co/Eo7wOUqeIO Great work whoever did this! @groovechicken Frozen 2: Freeze Harder Disney making Frozen sequel. Let's all guess what it will be called! I'm going with "Frozen 2: Origins - Rise of the Ice" @AtariBook That should work. PCB/copper far more susceptible to damage than ROM itself. @AtariBook running current through it before cleaning good way to fry it forever. Trailer for Star Wars: The Force Wakes Up was pretty cool. Clearly narrated by Benedict Cumberbatch, no mystery there. @KalebPapesh Nope. @eevblog Or they never bother using capital letters for their name or Street? @f5kn She didn't understand why a white cat needed a black outline :) @f5kn 6. the cat doesn't have stripes though. Oh well. @docdork Yes I know. We're going to try and pick it back up with a Christmas special. @JurvaVehasmaa Got Asteroids to work, Star Raiders didn't. Helped my niece paint a picture of her cat Boots. http://t.co/VxE4IA3rdz @bhockle Yes. PCB is in a lot better condition than Asteroids was as well (still didn't work "out of the box") Star Raiders from the Atari Landfill. Steel wool and rubbing alcohol can clean the contacts but that's not enough. http://t.co/5UbuGgmeWJ @graboid90 I believe so yes. Although I do spend lots of time playing videogames, that much is true. Slightly warmer weather + day before Thanksgiving = OLD-PEOPLE-MAGEDDON at the grocery store! @Vectrexer But I like making things look nice :( 3D printer in space, man I'm jealous of the overhangs they'll be able to achieve with that thing. Who needs support material? @Peppy_starfox Something's wrong with the g diffuser! Crap, almost forget. New TV means I have to play through Star Fox again, the best Star Wars game ever made (mind? blown?) @adreinhard Good. Maybe by analyzing booms and busts of history we might learn something for a change. Yes I'm still talking about this. Read how I got the Atari Landfill cartridge working again: http://t.co/ROUJMvPlXf Here is the repaired PCB. I will do a write up on my site latest tonight. The surgery will also appear on my show. http://t.co/NF5PBVuor6 Yes! I did it! Actual cartridge from the Atari Landfill, brought back to life after being buried for 31 years. http://t.co/20S8q8Rth5 Performing surgery to bring an Atari landfill cartridge back to life. And yes, they do smell like a dump. http://t.co/In6YbkVMOk @weeowey Probably some ex-Raven or Human Head developer used to live there, and now works on Far Cry. @ambihelical Fitchburg suburb is weird. It contains worst and nicest parts of Madison. That location kind of in middle. Weird random item to find in Far Cry 4. Address is real too, though suburb of Madison not Madison itself. http://t.co/1qqVYFV2yX @PackerBackerSTL Didn't they used to be pretty good a while back? Dear Interwebs: Is there a legal way to watch the final "IT Crowd" episode online? If I can't watch it, egg and my face will be in alignment @TheJonesCode @mypifi Right. It's obviously ALL my fault! Maybe a Christmas special? @PackerBackerSTL ...and the Vikings get one step closer to never winning a Superbowl ever :) @TheJonesCode is still alive! At pinball tournament. http://t.co/wLY3DOA218 Big batch of single handed Xbox One controllers getting ready to go. Wish PS4 didn't use that silly screened circuit. http://t.co/QkympenABI @cwkraft "It's just my opinion" "I kid,  I kid..." - what people say right after they say something they absolutely do believe. YouTube videos parodying amount of time modern games/systems spend updating are inaccurate. It's about 3 times longer actually. And this isn't even the largest margarita I have ever had, by a long shot. http://t.co/U3dfDXv8Wc @isocube Gonna blow your mind I liked Tron Legacy better than original. @element14 New shop just kind of shows up in Part 3, nothing too glamorous. @isocube All modern films are too long, so I agree. He could have saved a lot of time and money omitting that monster wrecking Vegas. @Veronica Soooooooo..... it's the Walking Dead of video games? @eevblog I have a saying "You never realize how may damn aircraft there are, until you try and film something outdoors" @eevblog For filming? In old shop we'd turn off furnace (to shoot) then forget to turn it back on and wonder why it got so cold. @eevblog Replaced 14 year old shop fridge with new "efficient" one and yeah, it's not as cold even turned all the way up. @eevblog Because of the blind? @b00gamonkey Thanks for supporting original themed pinball! Tell your friends! AVGN movie little too long, else great effort! Not sure why it gets so much hate. Did fans want 2 hours of him in basement? Probably. I'm going to watch "Angry Video Game Nerd The Movie". I published a Thing on @thingiverse! http://t.co/YUBLRUdNPZ #thingalert @tigheklory @travistyoj New few years? Android consoles already flooding the market. Not sure why. @travistyoj I shouldn't say this, but I believe this will be the shortest (and last) console generation ever. @bhockle My PC. Since getting a smart TV, don't even use my consoles for Netflix even. Sun warmed up the door enough to mount my new shop sign. First thing I milled with new dust collector on CNC. http://t.co/NZHqevm7Zh Worried about this console gen. We've had what, like maybe 6 actual next-gen only titles? And none I care about until Batman &amp; Fallout 4. @RaymeCVinson BTW Auto-Titans needs decent AI to "run away" from Nuke Titans else they always get destroyed. @stipo42 Figured leather would have a better grip. Most YouTubers now spend 1/5th their video pre-addressing everything a troll might bitch about. What a waste. @benheck Oh crap I used "its" incorrectly. I shall blame the new autocorrect. Mirror selfie! I went with the Moto X gen 2. Like it so far and its barely bigger than my old phone. http://t.co/ycvLEhPOYE @chorltonheelies Also X-Files was a much, much better show. @RaymeCVinson It's a great game! The Frontier [Tower] Defense mode is a great use of the enemy AI system. How many seasons before Mulder and Scully hooked up? 9? I don't think Walking Dead's Daryl and Carol are gonna live that long. @tigheklory I am making a Super Battery Indicator 2x2 and a Weather Strip (4x1) @tigheklory It's pretty cool. Not sure if resulting widgets kill battery or not. ZOOPER is a time machine app for Android. You starting fiddling around making custom widgets and suddenly you realize many days have passed. @CurtosNoir Yes temperature fell off a cliff this week. @kremsr 25 min on top of already too long movie, yeah no thanks. @kremsr They want to limit trailers to 2 minutes now... which just means you'll have to watch 9 instead of 7 of them. You know something else irrelevant in the age of the internet? Movie trailers... IN FRONT OF MOVIES. Seriously, get rid of them. @cwkraft it's been months since any lights turned on by themselves. Since MGC actually. My super sexy new Moto X. Soon my Android phone will no longer be ancient. http://t.co/NPnhEKKYt0 @dmunsie It's not too hard to build - easier than the Spectrum by a long shot! I'm OK with digital projection, but digital IMAX? We sit so close we can see the pixels. Fail. (note: our IMAX used to be real) @mypifi Ask @TheJonesCode Sending out email to anyone who's inquired about Single Handed Controllers since April. See also: http://t.co/jTgBqRRQ0D @YuriDedman It's a little further but yes. @TronicsLab I'm not gonna see the damn thing. But of course it will suck, it's a sequel after 20 years. It would almost be worth owning a McMansion just to be the ONE GUY who doesn't make you take your shoes off (even in summer?) upon entering. Finally able to sleep in on a weekend, haven't done that in months. Still in my pajamas, in fact! @mrwyrm we did a token operated Xbox like that a few years back. @TJConsoleRepair Reminds me, I need to watch Edge of Tomorrow again so I can see Sergeant Bill Paxton lay the smack down on Tom Cruise! @heavymetaldemon Great now I have to predict what OTHER ancient comedy trope will squirt out a decades-late sequel. @TJConsoleRepair Despite starring Bill Paxton - acting legend - I found Dread to be overly long and too self-indulgent. If Dumber 2 makes any amount of money, expect Broken Lizard to get on the "sequels make us relevant again!" bandwagon with Super Troopers 2. @vidm96 That's an ancient 7" car back of seat display. Probably off eBay. Mostly just wanted to use it up. @vidm96 The little one or the big one? Little is: http://t.co/pyFOQfjHTD Interstellar review: Don't take Anne Hathaway to space.

Atari bought rights AFTER it was a hit, leaving small 6 week window for coding. @aurich Well, it's OK but there's plenty of other, cheaper movies where 2/3rds the leads aren't dead that would be better! @aurich Hey, I'm busy writing why JAWS is a weak title on Pinside you know! @aurich Well there you go! Moon landing faked = confirmed! I applaud Ford for making an aluminum truck. And it's not a risk, Tesla's been doing it for years. Fixed that for you, media. @tigheklory @jow_42 @k3v2 @matthewhenzel He got paid NOT to be Harvey Dent in "Forever" (had contract but they wanted Tommy Lee Jones) @tigheklory @k3v2 @jow_42 @matthewhenzel Best. Batman. Evah. dannyelfmanFTW @jobutex Thanks! There are 2 more parts to the build - wonder what the end result will look like ? :) Walking Dead is an entire show made out of bottle episodes http://t.co/3tNkqiLkKJ - what are they doing with all the money they rake in? @element14 @Gizmodo That's cool. Keep in mind people have been building replicas for years, I'm not the first, this is just my take on it. Forgot the name of it, but I love Amazon's "Siri in a Pringles Can" Anybody know how I can get in an an invite? I would put it in my shop. @cheeseheadtv @PackerBackerSTL Holy cow what a beat down! @caseyspivey Yes. I take a lot of photos of products to email, and during events for Twitter. So maybe between Moto X and Xperia? RE phones: Battery life, camera and single handed use are most important to me. @Pgh_Hockey_Dad No. I understand that's a big part of 1+1 Been researching a new phone. Thinking Xperia Z3, Moto X or One+One. Any thoughts from users? On time flight out of LaGuardia. First time that's happened to me since... Ever.

Now to head over to @EngadgetExpand Hopefully making it to NYC this morning. What is with air travel this year - seems worse than usual. @telarium Off topic but I found 2600 Raiders just, if not MORE, damn confusing than ET. @ridley_john This is the part where I mention it's ironic we're trying to get mercury out of our TV's but are fine putting it in bulbs :) @telarium Yes like Todd Frye getting 1 million bucks for Atari 2600 Pac-Man. But let's face it - everybody bought it! One of those Atari Dump carts has a price sticker. Game programmed by 1 person in 1983 was $33, or $78 today. $275 mil GTA5 costs $60 today. @TheJonesCode @cwkraft You can not escape Twitter. It is your Destiny... your favorite game. New Star Wars name is OK. Just glad it wasn't "Star Wars: Episode 7 - Rise of the Age of Darkness Begins: Origins" @cwkraft @TheJonesCode And there's why they're switching to digital. Cool that some real prints being made. Think Fitchburg IMAX going fake. Used to think apps in TVs were pointless but now love them! Guess it saves power too. @BabblingGeek @Respawn @RaymeCVinson Most fails occur on final wave maybe balance more difficulty into earlier waves? @Respawn @RaymeCVinson Cool! Been playing a lot of Frontier Defense! Maybe make it even harder? @joystiq I must see if they still work! @ILpinballclub Remakes! So yes, I have to own one of these, and I expect there's a good chance the ROM will still work. Guess this proves they didn't just bury ET cartridges http://t.co/KoXa9n4fJJ lots of unsold stuff had flooded the market. 12 digit number, so just under 1 trillion unique bar codes on the planet. Aren't they going to run out thanks to Frozen merchandise? @tigheklory @engadgetexpand I agree. Chicago style tends to be a bit much - can only eat a couple slices. @tigheklory @engadgetexpand I guess it looks OK. But maybe they could try toppings once in a while? @tigheklory @engadgetexpand Gross. Going to be a host at @engadgetexpand this weekend in New York. Looking forward to seeing all the new tech and eating thin, floppy pizza. @Mad_Bike_Life That is a stretch! @bhockle Yes it turned out quite pretty in the end - you'll see!

Time to say goodbye! http://t.co/jkUgPXYOP5 @benheckAOB You're probably the guy who has my Steam handle! :) @aurich Yes I was pleased it didn't rely entirely on nostalgia like a lesser movie would have. I liked Wreck-It Ralph. Solid story, lots of heart, and it wasn't wall-to-wall references in lieu of content. Going to finally watch Wreck It Ralph, so I know what my friends with kids are talking about when they reference it. @TU_L3T A 100 mil game costs $60 now, a 2 mil game cost $50 twenty years ago. Seems like a bargain to me! @TU_L3T Games cost WAY more than in 90s! But they sell more, and don't come on expensive cartridges. A $50 game in 1990 would be $91 now. $60 modern game + $30 season pass... hey wait a minute! @notgonnahashtag Needs volts, resistance, amperage minimum.

Activity of the day: Name movies where the soundtrack was more popular/successful than the movie itself. Example: Dangerous Minds. @rsg All on a perfect time schedule, no less! Bad guy wants to get caught / magic blood two tropes that movies need to dump ASAP. @rsg Yeah, Skyfall didn't make a lick of sense. "Let's protect M by taking her to a farmhouse and defending it Home Alone style!" Bond 78 starts filming soon.

Power strips surge protectors: Why can't they include a paper pattern or even just holes notched in the box to help with mounting screws? @cwkraft @LnghrnEngineer And no better game since! @LnghrnEngineer Type it in from a magazine! Internet working in new shop. Now I can finally order this http://t.co/UTof5eberR for our Super Break Room (TM) @FLYingG0D Never gone that far! I am not a monster! Moving all shop furniture today. Then we'll have someplace to put the piles of stuff! @Oglesan Google Toaster Reflow oven you'll find many examples. Sometime I open the same website on both monitors to increase my time-wasting productivity 200% In final stages of moving the shop. Then comes the arranging and setting up - ugh! @PirateTravis I've been asked on items under $20. Sigh. Curious if the pure profit retail gets from "service plans" makes up for the people who shop online to avoid arguing about service plans. Meatloaf was improved. Cooked it a little too long. Maybe I should flip it halfway through next time? Attempt 2 out of 3 to make Flavor Wave meatloaf. Hope it ain't bad. http://t.co/jYeuihoXDZ @brokentoken Thanks! Tell all your friends!

AMH will be there and I here Bill Paxton Pinball is making a glorious return! @aurich I am bringing down the one I've been coding on last few weeks. So they'll be more than one there? http://t.co/4UXmtlu4SS Would say this is proof the zombie trend has gone too far, but Animal Planet has a ghost show too, go figure. @tigheklory I'm a movie of the Tim Burton movie ABOUT Ed Wood, not Ed Wood or his movies.

RT @LnghrnEngineer: MacroFab landing page launched! http://t.co/kn1opv8e31 Feels great to get it out there! @jimmylipham I didn't write that program. I can ask the guy, but I think he still wants to tweak it. @x Thanks! Writing more code to make it awesome-er. Is that a word? Now to strip out everything I possible can from this program until it stops work... Ben Style! @CurtosNoir 13th week of 1937? It's a time traveling chip :) Got the CNC *mostly* reassembled at the new shop. Mostly. @jimmylipham It's on my website. Yes basically series of bitmaps that go directly to the screen buffer. @aurich I plan to be there both days. Is this your first Chicago expo? Adding a bunch of requests, flourishes and "nice to haves" on America's Most Haunted for Pinball Expo next week. @civrays We have a couple, will probably slot it into a future episode yes. There's already enough songs with the ridiculous premise of a woman not knowing how beautiful she is, please stop making them thanks. @DMackey828 Seasons 1 and 2 were good. It's basically a soap opera with occasional zombie attacks. Let's place bets on how long they can milk this "Terminus" location on Walking Dead. 1 season? 3 seasons? Nobel prize for Blue LED is awesome! Now what about the invention of the glue gun? "Did you fill out your reward survey for https://t.co/aCh2DMZ6EP ?"... ..."Bingo!" @DanielNear Haha no Viagra! Though Google has probably profiled me as unmarried by now. @DanielNear Maybe I'll see those in about 10 years :) If insurance ceased to insist, the advertising industry would collapse the day after. @tigheklory It's gonna sit awhile, gotta have it framed, takes up room in shop. I'll give you fifty bucks. @thestudcomic Yes but we didn't consider that feasible. Would need a good seal on top of can = not really repeatable. Inflation! $20 billion used to buy you 5 or 6 Space Shuttles. Now all it'll get you is a cross-platform messenger app. Actually going to a Chuck E Cheese for a kids birthday party is far more terrifying than that Five Nights At Freddies game could ever be. @rubber_jonnie I wanna say that WAS the 1050. My original first computers disk drive that conked out early 90s. @cwkraft @TheJonesCode Nah they'll just get Jeffrey Dean Morgan to lose some weight and re-cast. http://t.co/LlNBCsHIf7 Doing 2 more weeks of AMH coding before Expo. Plus moving my shop. So yeah, kind of exhausted already. Perfect example of engineers using "what they know" Atari 800 computer disk drive, has CPU and RAM from 2600. http://t.co/GVpy4xeJl1 @sdsolle @Raspberry_Pi Well to be specific, a Pi with no through-hole installed. It would be super handy. Lot easier to add than remove. Felix and I got the big CNC torn down, moving it to new shop tomorrow. Solid steel is heavy, it turns out! @MNeko Oh so you bought a video card from 2011? SICK BURN! @tigheklory That thing is OOOOOLLLLLLLDDDDDDD! @bhockle Not into the movie but the pin looks fantastic! Even though it's eye-numbingly monotonous, I quite enjoy hand wiring 8-bit computers. While watching documentary on Meatloaf. @xUno10x Ideas that fit in 140 characters are the best kind :) @eevblog going from 900 to 1500 Yankee square feet. When you see a grossly skinny model or actress just think - that's *after* the camera has added 20 pounds! @rangerricksite Ah that was last fall when we interviewed him for our show. Cool! @rangerricksite Oh cool. I've met him several times, wonder when it was? He now has a cool beard! Chuck dropped an AMH off at my home. Adding more code for expo, and this unit for sale at show cash and carry. http://t.co/Ja6kpx0fVT We are in that? Some sort of documentary? @cwkraft Windows One @RafaLagoon @TheRegister Search for ZX spectrum schematic! Hollywood expects people to take them seriously on topics like politics, global warming &amp; poverty, then green-lights "Tetris: The Movie" @Mad_Bike_Life Such violence. Many nerf. Wow. @adamdicarlo @tehaynes Season 5 will probably involve a battle over a toilet paper factory. @tehaynes Same person who shaves women's legs in caveman movies? Watching Walking Dead Season 4 and wondering how in a world covered by leaves anyone can sneak up on anybody? @dr_spoosatron I did an entire panel once as SNL Jeopardy Sean Connery. @mattjbaldo No I am not falling into the trap of more space = more junk. We need more space to make filming better. Well it's official. We will be moving to a larger shop by November. Hopefully this doesn't confuse and astound our audience. @LordThree I also don't think Star Trek V is the worst Trek movie, or Last Crusade is best Indy movie - I'm funny that way. Finally watched a Rocky V. Why all the hate? For one thing, it's an actual movie unlike Part 4 The Montage. @onaclov2000 Mind. Blown. Before you ask someone at a booth a question, consider - how many times have they been asked that already? @bukosky_melony I sure am! Just today though. @cwkraft Just sell your test prints at end of the day :) @theCamelCaser @MkeMakerFaire Green tablecloth booth near red inflatable robot. Free show T shirts! @MkeMakerFaire Brought many Ben Heck Show shirts. Stop by booth to get one free as a thanks for watching! @MkeMakerFaire seems cool so far. Haven't really looked around yet. @theCamelCaser @MkeMakerFaire During the day tomorrow. Going to @MkeMakerFaire tomorrow! I'll try and bring some Ben Heck Show shirts if anyone wants one. Web security questions should be things trapped in your mind, not stuff people could find on Facebook or public records. @skaluv Yeah like the word "Vista" they have to stop using 8 ASAP. Still gonna be legions of us clinging to 7, just like people with XP. Report: Apple stocks soar as thousands of YouTube clickbait channels start bending iPhones in half and then buy new ones. Software companies really hate counting past 10, even rebooting if need be (Adobe) How long has Apple been on OSX anyway? @tigheklory It belongs in a museum! @cwkraft See also: antiques. @cwkraft It's a trick - you're bidding on the opportunity to haul away garbage for someone. @tigheklory We're probably just going to move to a bigger space anyway. Think our new junker neighbors buy storage units. Much like a pawn shop, something fun to watch on TV you wouldn't want to live by. @tigheklory The film he did after, Ed Wood, is my favorite film of all time. Returns had a crap script biggest problem. Haven't run Netflix on my PS3 in a while, and its not requiring an update? Think I'm still dreaming, or trapped in a computer simulation. @benheck Holy cow this movie falls apart in the 3rd act. Penguin and Catwoman are pretty cool though. Don't think I need to see it again. @tigheklory Plus second one has a masquerade ball scene, like all bad movies do (true fact look it up!) @tigheklory First one is a stylistic awesome mess. Second one is a monotonous, repetitive mess with really fake city sets. It's been 5 years. Time to watch Batman Returns again and see if I still don't like it. Got some of these in today. The chip that launched a thousand ships! http://t.co/Vs5MLzLy0g @eevblog We have a 13 year old fridge in shop, still leagues quieter than when the furnace kicks on. @cwkraft Maybe it's cute on one side, Phantom of the Opera on the other. I also like the idea of cancerous lumps all over it, oozing acid. @cwkraft 3rd deer needs to be messed up genetic mistake. Deer Fetus attacks in abandoned lab a la "Aliens" Ripley/Newt/Burk scene. @cwkraft We need to set up that there are 3 evil deer, so the audience can keep track of what's stalking them. @cwkraft There's 3 deer "characters" plus a deer fetus. Maybe the female could be a Musk deer so she has more kill-ability. Killability. It's true. All my movie ideas involve "genetic animal testing done for a good cause... which turns them evil!" Also, takes place in woods. @benheck Forgot to say "which of course turns them evil!" People in woods stalked by deer genetically enhanced to be smart enough not to run in front of traffic. @tigheklory "Brain Deer" @Ecamaro1970 I'd also recommend something pre-built. Spend your time printing, not assembling! :) @tigheklory Good point. So it was like an ounce and a half? Been going down lately. @Ecamaro1970 http://t.co/RS4ID7ixOy Good quality, low price and American company unlike most sub 1k printers. @Ecamaro1970 Gave it away years ago. Use a Makerbot, SeeMeCNC and Cube now. Electronic gold recovery videos on YouTube are interesting, but they probably make more on views than they do with the metals. Was looking up deer skeleton images and Google linked to a ransomware site on first page of results? Fail. @Chris_Gammell @eevblog @TheAmpHour Dave would like that. They are like the Solar Frickin' Roadways of cell phones! @Chris_Gammell @eevblog @TheAmpHour Why modular cell phones are BS? @James___UK Seems any year ending in 4 or 9. Except this year. 1984 - the best year for movies ever? http://t.co/YY2DakxW0r @BrianBagnall1 @redlettermedia Samurai Cop transcends language and opens the mind to possibilities we as humans can't even understand yet. Documenting my pinHeck system since people want to make games with it. Wish I could just download from my brain right to a Wiki, sigh. @Teamicro I am no longer doing last-gen projects, sorry. PS4, might be interested in that. @redlettermedia was right, Samurai Cop is a very good bad movie, truly The Best of the Worst (or right up there) @Arkanoid0 I have one so no reason to build it. @mattgriffin Die Hard 5 and other crap your argument makes sense. But wouldn't they rather have $6 than $0? I rarely watch movies twice. @mattgriffin Die Hard 5 (Fox) was buy-only as well. @mattgriffin New stuff I can understand. But 1-3 year old titles do it as well. Conspiracy theories on why some digital movies are buy only, not rent? I'm guessing bandwidth cost is the same so they're going for margin. @hackmodford yes I have one at home and it made using my work PC a chore by comparison! @rgausnet There's a few. I wouldn't feel safe building something that could burn a hole in me or destroy an eyeball if I messed up. Re-installing my shop PC with an SSD and listening to John Barry compilations via YouTube. @Mad_Bike_Life @TheJonesCode "Jar Jar Rules! Snatcher is a quality game." @NESretroZONE Nice one! @vkoskiv I've built briefcase printers before, close enough? @andrewjsledge Technically they were flip flops (the sandal not the circuit) @tigheklory Yes. It has come to that! @benheck Seeing the shoes now has my brain stuck on multiverse string theory, as well as simulated universe. Astounded. I saw a PAIR of shoes laying beside an on ramp this morning. If I believed in signs, this could be one! Yahoo! Done with work by 5:20 today! That's above average lately. @jonty @RagwormUK @emfcamp Cool. Yes I'll do something with it on a future episode of the show. @msenese @make Good thing it's aluminum! @RagwormUK @emfcamp Hm. I assume the bootloader is intact. @RagwormUK @emfcamp brought a few back haven't had time to work with it yet. I loved how it didn't flip itself over like most badges. @eevblog 4K = 4X render/upload time. It's just a gimmick to sell more TV's since sales are in the toilet. Companies need it, not consumers. @Cloudscout Dora the Internet Explorer. @Cloudscout "Silly PuTTY: The Movie" @Cloudscout Obama Home Refinance: Origins Once Hollywood runs out of video games to make terrible movies out of they'll try desktop apps: "Clippy: Rise of the Spreadsheets" @Jeffers727 Seems to be. I've used it for heatsinks in the past. A negative to working on something til it's finished, instead of over the years, is getting hit with the reality of how long it takes. @mmoroca That's actually on the schedule in a few months. I love old 8-bit computers! @element14 Oh no! @f5kn There was an adapter that went on base of Gamecube to do exactly that. @mickburkesnr Road House has a better love story than Twilight. "Ooo you just beat up that guy with a knife in his shoe? That's hot!" @SabrinaD I don't think anything I own is remotely old enough to interest them! "Can't Fight the Moonlight" reminds me how dumb "Coyote Ugly" was. It was a Michael Bay PG-13 strip club scene stretched to an entire film. Building a lot of next-gen controller monitors for upcoming games. Looks like another evening of soldering, American Pickers and Arby's. @Prog98 Palmer was on our forums years ago! @mustachesound Nope! Not mine. #nintendobuycapcom And it wouldn't cost a fraction of SnapChat, Mojang, Oculus, Twitch, etc. @trkzn @Clive_Sinclair Awesome! We use white plastic for projects quite often as it's easier to photograph. Glad it wasn't too weird! @frasermoo I don't think Alaska would fit in my oven. Not bothering to pre-heat the oven: What once seemed like laziness now passes as environmentalism. I love no-effort solutions! Stopped by the Mad Rollin Tourney. It's been going on for 9+ hours! http://t.co/tGo1ZVU8da Must drive landlords nuts that "No Pets" is interpreted as "Cats OK!" and "No Smoking" someone doesn't apply to pot? @adamnaser Faster than grabbing the multimeter. Do not use on car batteries :) @ILpinballclub It is a new game from Dennis that is out of this world! At Dennis Nordman's shop, checking out his new pinball machine. It is very awesome I like it a lot! His games are always different. Why not just cut to the chase, come up with a "Superhero Zombies" IP and reduce all media to a single genre? @tigheklory That gives it the authentic taste! I don't usually collect stuff, but might have to make a run at one of these: http://t.co/1yxve0kjw2 @_Lemonassassin @Black_Six That's the purpose of the Element14 forums. But still, a lot of hacking info piled up on Benheck Forums. @Veronica "I'm afraid my condition has left me cold... to your pleas of MERCY!" @jessiewonka Really? All my friends know I'm anti-Apple. Well, not anti. I just don't worship them. @rangerricksite No. @daniolidregaliz In 2-3 years a smartphone will fit on a watch. But not yet. @TAGmedia That's the future. Be a great use of the power of modern PC's. @TJConsoleRepair Smartphones have certainly replaced PC's for a great many people. It's a fact. When a "smartwatch" replaces my cellphone and is so small and light I forget I'm wearing it, then I'll care. @bre Maybe Fry's electronics? Turn them into mini-Frys? When the Shack folds, much of America will lose a retail outlet for such items. 50% of server security questions involve marriage details. Gee, thanks for reminding me I'm single, WHM. Jerk. Lady, would you just stay with the guy already? I'm sick of hearing him whine about it in the radio. Apple fans the world over starting lining up to buy something Samsung's been selling since 2011. Behold, the end of Apple innovation. @Blackhivemedia Liked 1st Infamous, haven't played them since. Haven't played new consoles much at all. Maybe it's just me. @stipo42 My issue is 90% of games are also on 360/PS3, so we haven't seen what next gen is capable of yet. Batman: Arkham Knight looks like the first REAL next-gen game. And it's coming next June. 19 months after the new consoles released. Sigh. @eevblog @makerbot Avoid sharp turns that might move the print head and send energy back into the stepper drivers! @Black_Six True. But there's still incoming links, so it's useful to people searching. I do still care about http://t.co/Qg6uWmwxzt forums. Installed to new server, latest phpBB. Should switchover tomorrow. Thinking about making a movie next year. Big question is: Does monofilament show up in 4K? @jimmylipham It's a stock AFM, spiderman Tron target mech, but the motor half we made custom. I thought I was going crazy. Then I realized I had enabled "Speed Volume" on my car. (turns down radio when you come to a stop) @CAExtremeOrg @JAsanmateo http://t.co/GI7IhsixSk @artistxforever @RaymeCVinson He's also sad because soon he'll have to spend much of the Wayne fortune replacing those inkjet cartirdges. @TAGmedia Yes I do. Please visit http://t.co/m7XwqMoBOl and use the contact info there, thanks! @TAGmedia The SNES and Genesis were far more different. Twice the RAM, better graphics on SNES, twice the speed, worse graphics on Genesis. This current console war is like politics. Billions spent and countless arguments over two things that are 80% the same. @Cloudscout Haha brilliant! @yzf600 I don't buy into Micro USB. Not that much smaller, but much flimsier connector. Added an FTDI UART to interface with my TRS - 80 Model 100's UART chip, works great! USB backup baby! http://t.co/My4EhE1vIc @zerosozha Animal House: Retribution This Indiana Jones Blu-Ray set is great! It comes with all three Indiana Jones movies, a "Making Of" disc, plus a coaster! @MatubSDMF No problem! Thanks for fabbing it! @SonicSageGamer No, I'm suggesting you all generate stupid comedy sequel names. Like "Neighbors: Rise of the Condo" @SonicSageGamer Ironically, the one sequel with a clever name that nobody went to! Unlike all other movies, comedy sequels just slap on a "2". Let's think of titles if they DIDN'T do that, like "Hangover: Origins" - go! @anymouse_404 That's the sequel, don't get ahead of yourself! @anymouse_404 Oh brilliant. Developed during WW2 to defend the coast, frozen for 70 years, unthawed for terror! How to name a bad sci-fi movie: Take any word in the English language + Shark. @jakecoogle Saw some clips of mob guys shooting at the bed... seems dumb enough for me! @mattjbaldo @Stanto @JonS_WF1 @zen_studios @KerbalSpaceP Some sort of space pin would be cool. I enjoy my Space Shuttle. Bad movie night double feature next weekend. Movie #1 obtained! http://t.co/Mba9iV5mxA @KerbalSpaceP @Stanto @JonS_WF1 I would hope space travel doesn't involve explosions! @Stanto @JonS_WF1 Space pins always cool! @angryaussie @eevblog It's like Rule of Hollywood: "Never use your own money" Plus often it'd just for publicity they already have $$$ @TheJonesCode @Mad_Bike_Life Blu Ray of that arrives today! @Mad_Bike_Life @alexw07 Samurai Cop is recommended by @redlettermedia so that's enough for me! @generalelectric Fast food burgers to ensure they're assembled correctly. @ILpinballclub If it's something people have heard of, no matter how old, it's considered better than a new idea. Sigh. @ultrafez @Benjie @leedshackspace Indeed! @mattjbaldo The inverse, Positive Jet Lag, is perhaps not a good term since it implies the jet lag is good? @mattjbaldo Going backwards (west) instead of forwards (east). Dunno that's just what I've always called it. Was able to get over my negative jet lag very easily - stayed up until it got slightly dark in Midwest, then slept for 12 hours! @MorRobots You do realize an already inappropriate # of people have sent me unsolicited messages about that, right? @SquallStrifeAU Ah cool, thanks for the tip. @Jacob_Orth1 @KerbalSpaceP Yes I have friends who play that religiously. In one week, the next generation finally, officially begins with a game that's... oh... wait... also on PS3 and 360. @MorRobots Nah, I'd say "giant iPod Touch" was crazy enough to count as innovation. When (not if) Apple releases their own giant "Phablet Phone" they'll officially become a reactionary company, no longer an innovative one. Now I am back in the States. My plant did not die so that's good. We are prepping more episodes of the show. @Workshopshed @StuartSJones That would be awesome. I just don't have the time. Ditching another late connection from Chicago to Madison. Think I'm going to use the bus from now on. @StuartSJones @Stanto He did! @aurich Granted 20 years ago it was "Super". New 3DS not even called anything though. Perhaps PS4 is a success by avoiding the  "What's the stupidest name we can give our hardware?" race Microsoft and Nintendo are in. @EGeek_Online @emfcamp Yes that could make a great episode for our show! What was the deal with the battery meter? Heading back to airport from @emfcamp Thanks everyone for putting on such a great event! Excited to program my badge. @paulmartin42 @phenoptix @ChickenGrylls @guru @emfcamp Normally don't have one but grew it out for camping! Looks like the lawyers had a go at this toilet sign. Glad they cleared that up. http://t.co/sVWeE1P4qf Showers work quite well @emfcamp I've been to more than one hotel that had worse ones without excuse of being in an open field! @MorRobots Ha very good! Not sure I'd ever want to hire a toilet. It'd probably do a crappy job. http://t.co/A3lZ8lqqF0 Did an interview with the BBC regarding my Zed Ex Spectrum portable. Doing a talk at EMF camp at 6:00 At EMF camp. The North Remembers! http://t.co/pJE2GUwzLB No giant English slugs were stepped on during the making of The Ben Heck Show. http://t.co/87xAFQ735J @dougalshaw really not sure Chris is bringing them but extra help never a bad thing. @dougalshaw Have an interview at 10, then setting up tents. @boredofjam When I get back to the States I'm gonna scream "Zeeeeeeeeeee!" at the top of my lungs! @StuartSJones "A key without six functions is a key wasted!" - Sir Clive Sinclair Now you can enjoy Clive Sinclair's wonder computer, the Zed Ex Spectrum, wherever you may travel, including trains. http://t.co/e003tYYeA1 Toggle buttons for temperature and fan in hotel. They go back and forth like to Cylon eye. http://t.co/bBPdUYMbOO @xawul @computermuseum Where is this museum? @xawul I'm just going to call it the Speccy and avoid controversy :) @jdiezlopez Very well I see. I expect we shall figure it out upon our arrival. @jdiezlopez What is a village? How do we join one? @StuartSJones We will win ALL the Oscars. If Steve Jobs can almost get two different movies, Clive deserves at least one. So now we're drinking brews and discussing a Clive Sinclair movie starting Charles Dance (the old Lannister from Thrones) @Bh1992 Actually acquired a Timex Sinclair (the lame US version) as a proper years ago and always wanted the real deal. Spotted randomly at a bar in Leeds. 30 quid in town here. May have to acquire one! http://t.co/y8jCKsKdAx @Mad_Bike_Life Were your flights OK? @ElXando Its mostly empty, giant heatsink though. Clearly they wanted to avoid any possible overheating this time! @ElXando Haven't gotten around to it! @element14 main super office in Leeds. Going to do a talk about our show. Also, still not caught up on jet lag. @apparentlymart Saw it at Kings Cross station and also here in Leeds. Amazon + Twitch a merger that makes sense! Link IP matches to products, use views to estimate stock/demand, strongarm IP holders that oppose @kwownoname mind. Blown. @kwownoname The accents ate pretty thick here. It reminds me of Boston. Numbers start at zero here in England. The programmer in me loves that! [0] http://t.co/QHGXTFS3au @pdp7 Coincidentally I just slapped a T mobile Sim in my nexus here in the UK. @kwownoname Yes I made it OK. Two delayed flights and no sleep later I arrive in Leeds. Yahoo. @WetDaddy thanks again! The original is still intact, just used it as reference to hand wire the Speccy. Leaving Chicago soon. Bringing my ZX Spectrum portable back to its homeland. On my way to England for the EMF event later this week. Wonder if I forgot anything? Probably. Have my sleeping pills at least. Ever stop and wonder just how long it'll take for USB to get phased out? It's as ubiquitous as wall sockets now. @hello Hey it's that thing from Guardians of the Galaxy! @NickHamze I don't want it to email me asking to approve comments that are obviously spam. It's spamming me RE spam. Got the paid version of Askimet for my website, and it emails me about spam. Lame. Gonna try Facebook comments. @bflores I don't know. I am not involved with distribution. I just make stuff. @TAGmedia Exactly like that. Imagine how useful that'd be. Use the power of desktops to analyze speech. @TAGmedia Naturally speaking operating systems. Wish we could fast forward past Modular Cell Phones, "the cloud" and wearables and get to some actual new technology already. RE: Ben Heck Show, you can still find it on element14/tbhs or subscribe via YouTube. And I'll never ditch my sidekicks. If that "Pina Colada Song" guy ever puts up a new personal ad looking for "women not into Yoga" he's gonna be single forever! I would take the Ice Bucket Challenge, if the reward was not having to hear about the damn Ice Bucket Challenge anymore. @boylinux http://t.co/mJGbOxa4YE Minnesota State Fair: Lock on AMH was broken, but they didn't get the money. Lock fixed, game back in order. Have fun! @LoganKes MOSET issues, thermistor/thermocouple issues, G-code turning off elements for some reason? Our new pinball America's Most Haunted earns so much, it got robbed at Minnesota State Fair! Why am I happy about this??? @redqueen76 It's Munster. But I cut off and ate the rinds already :) Operation "Eat all Perishable Food Before My Trip" is in full effect. Except the cheese. Not sure I can finish that. @DanielNear @eevblog I have a 2007 Sony Bravia DLP. Still works great, original bulb. My mom is visiting the shop today. If her and Alyson's mom ever visit same time, we're going to make them fight for our amusement. @LapTop006 Taxes. @LapTop006 No because of energy usage. @eevblog CA banned DLP bulb based TVs years ago. Wire a FTDI directly to the Model 100's UART and wow, it's talking to a computer 30 years in the future. http://t.co/nWvKrMeLTm @Mad_Bike_Life Don't forget our fan-fiction script for X-Files 3: The Truth is Out There. @cwkraft @TheJonesCode Profit = (Box Office / 2) - (Budget * 1.5) Studios only get roughly half of gross, budget is increased by marketing. Using lav mics with a t-shirt can be tricky. I've designed this 3D print to help myself and others with that http://t.co/YEhzWjJtIr @inof8or @HackadayPrize It could eventually monitor other things too. And who doesn't pee every day? Looking at the @HackadayPrize entries this is my fav so far: http://t.co/gSkuiSAA3L Don't laugh! BTW I'm not judging, just observing. @KalebPapesh http://t.co/0c6gYqCAVp @AmericanAir Staple that apology to a check for $453 (out of pocket costs + last quarter of flight unfulfilled) and mail it to me. Another cancellation from @americanair! Between the bus, hotel and cabs I'm gonna be $300+ out of pocket thanks to them. @Mad_Bike_Life Really don't understand Instagram. Seems like Twitter with filters. @Mad_Bike_Life Wow that took you long enough! Heard an anti Uber / Lyft PSA at airport. Chicago, unshockingly. @sector67 @HackadayPrize @bobbaddeley If you win bring me back some space rocks. @AmericanAir You can't control the weather. But you can control how you treat customers affected by it. My travel cost jumped 33%. Expendables 3 went PG-13 to "expand the audience" to 14 year olds who care about 1980s action stars? And they wonder why it bombed? @LoganKes Sounds like it's not fully screwed on. Take it apart and clean it if possible. @americanair cancelled 3367 out of Hobby, made us wait an hour to learn we're not even getting comped for hotels or cabs on morning flight. @NewhavenBridge @eevblog @YouTube Yeah! What kind of dweeb would do that right? @Mad_Bike_Life How much groceries did you buy??? @eevblog @YouTube There's something worse: people who don't speak and replace it with screens of text. @walltechOSHW @txrxlabs Great work you're doing Wall tech! Keep it up and you'll go far! @theCamelCaser Perhaps. Not sure yet. It's a TFT - Texas Food Table! http://t.co/IkWQFYMSUh @yertnamreg @LnghrnEngineer I'm here to eat all the brisket! @walltechOSHW I've heard it's quite the place, looking forward to checking it out. @dan_sanderson Yes what does the memory switch do? Kill all RAM programs? In Dallas en route to Houston. Probably going to the TXRX Hackerspace tonight. Maybe eat a rib beef. @Jeffers727 No complaints? When would that ever happen? Dear internet: Many people in the world would love to have problems as simple as "I can't buy Tomb Raider for my PS4, wah!" @tigheklory It works as USB too. Has both plugs because it's AMAZING! Threw my felt coaster I stole from a Northwoods bar in the wash. Now it's good for another 14 years! http://t.co/q3LCCKqGCC @Mel_G_Kirk You only tweeted it once so it's all good. @dan_sanderson Wait how does that work? @dan_sanderson Yes had to fix some corroded traces on the keyboard, all keys working now. Neat machine! I like the RAM file save. @MNeko The Model 100 is going up in price thanks to Halt &amp; Catch Fire. Got my beat up 26 year old PC-7 some new friends. http://t.co/WxiexAL5Pm Good scripts define characters through their actions. Bad scripts define characters through their backstories. @Mad_Bike_Life Forget about your baby brother, Jenny Blake! @pdp7 I guess toasting might help "bind" their "creation" into a more stable unit. Subway "Sandwich Arists"? More like abstract art, with a blindfold on, during an earthquake. "Rise/s/ing" is getting stupidly overused in titles. Do an IMDB search and despair. Trend has reached to gaming as well. @eevblog Might backlight screen, add li-po's, hack DB-25 serial into a useful port, add FTDI UART. Basically make a cool terminal. @eevblog Yes your video helped remind me how much I wanted one. Be fun to hack it to do more! No way in hell I'd have ever gotten one of these back in the day $$$ http://t.co/Tb3aUJU1YB but now thanks to eBay, will soon! #excited Check out my @HackadayPrize overview &amp; suggestions here http://t.co/gAFhcmu02Q @LoganKes Menards, Hobby Lobby, Woodcraft. Quality varies. Usually erroneously labeled 1/4" @DannyVonBas I can't believe I did that. Phone/tablet screens are advancing in resolution faster than monitors ever did, yet some sites still default to serving mobile version? @isocube Ok I promise not to steal the standard Italian bottom layout. Oh wait. Sure-fire way to get on TV: Visit "Pawn Stars", be a woman, wear cleavage shirt, bend over glass. BOOM! You're B-Roll! @ZombieIRL Well sure. Implying that things aren't peachy-keen all over the globe isn't politically correct these days. @scarce_sense Oh shoot I spelled it wrong! NOOOOOO! @bronwynECG Hey Justin Bieber actually has a purpose in this world! I'll loose followers over this but here goes: Why can't LAME celebrities die for a change? Alyson's crossfit team of four needs a name. Here are some ideas we've had. Thoughts? http://t.co/TPlXEmzEqT Fantasy Football is Dungeons and Dragons for sports fans. @nickrbrewer Pizza Oven, Rossi's Pizza, Pooleys all have multiple machines. Eating leftover spaghetti and updating my website. What an exciting day. Also I used Armor All to clean my steering wheel. @LnghrnEngineer Your pet horse will love it! @kwownoname Trash cat would be dead from diabetes three times over by that point. @kwownoname Lydia would be graduating college by time you finished watching Hobbit trilogy. OK, if I can get this one thing working correctly, I'll go home and stop working on a Sunday. Because that's just lame! @kwownoname You could watch The Hobbit trilogy but it would take more than just a single Sunday. @TheJonesCode First is awesome, sequels are junk. Just like Spider-Man, don't need to see reboot to know original is better. @cwkraft Ugggggghhhhhhhhhh. Dear anyone with taste in movies: I'd like to profoundly apologize for the idiots my age taking their kids to "Ninja Turtles", also "Smurfs" How all new companies are named: "Is the dot com available for a reasonable price? OK, great - we're going with Tasteticles!" @three14 Haha wait til people see the color scheme I picked! @ILpinballclub That's the weird part, aside from Karate Kid remake, they don't. @MarkRein @NBCSN same goes for movie trailers in front of movies! We like 80's movies because they did cool, original ideas. So instead of 80's remakes, give us cool original ideas. Wow. Simple, right? GOTG On the one hand, this printer is taking a while to dial in. On the other, I'll never be wanting for 3D printed chip clips. @ileff I have new one on my Nexus tablet. But my phone I purposefully never let update. Twitter, I will update your app for my phone over my cold, dead phone's body! Seriously, don't like the most current build. Time to crank the Fleetwood Mac and get this last-minute, ships-in-the-morning programming done Midwest style! This month is going to go past in the blink of an eye. This page of the cute kitten calendar forever lost, like tears in the rain. @TJConsoleRepair My list only has a few items, so I had to. Make them count. Does anyone need a lead singer for a country western band? I really want to cross that one off my bucket list. Dear Sony: Ghostbusters reboot is a line in the sand you shouldn't cross. Just let it die and come up with sometime new, like Marvel did! Here's the chip clip I just designed whilst working on printer calibrations: http://t.co/uWD1bXhi9I "If you design a better chip clip, @thingiverse will beat a path to your door" - Socrates @richthofen Both movies were colorful and involved space. That's probably the comparison they made. @richthofen 5th Element is awesome! @cwkraft It was your standard Marvel "everyone is after this one THING" plot, but straightforward. It'll be biggest movie of the summer. @cwkraft The unique feel was humor, heart, action and a good script. Rare qualities in modern film. Wow. Guardians of the Galaxy is going to make a killing. Hasn't been a movie like this in a long time. Ever consider that the reason Chewie didn't get a medal in #StarWars was because Carrie Fisher couldn't reach that high on camera? @hackmodford I've done (2) Atari 800 laptops and a Apple IIgs one. Not many 8 bit computers left for me! (big ones at least) @TheJonesCode Those "words" didn't come from me! I may say weird things like "zee" and "mul-tim-meter" but unlike everyone else on web, I'll always use "irony" and "coincidence" correctly. @IrregularShed Hahaha! I'll never say Zed. Never! Hahahaha! @TheJonesCode is that still a store? This original hardware, hand-rewired ZX Spectrum portable is one of the coolest things we've built on the show excited for people to see it. Granted it's still a comic book, but hopefully "Galaxy" success will get more interesting, original big budget movies greenlit. @cwkraft The Illinois - Indiana border economy depends on it! Business advice of the day: Unless your store sells things too large to easily ship, get out of the retail business while you can. @LoganKes Z cable backwards? Alyson's mom stopped by to lecture her on wearing proper layers of muscle T's to work. "You'll catch your death!" http://t.co/vJGy4hmBeV @Wireless_Mike maybe if I have room. Have some newer projects we are bringing for sure. @Be_A_Maker When is it exactly? @electromanlc @Mad_Bike_Life Thanks for stopping by! @WMoecke Thanks! I am going to restore the original Speccy once project is done (plus imorovements) The overload of commercials on radio is getting so bad I can "circle the dial" and not find any music. Free, at what cost? @AniGeekVA Ah no, because the plastic would be worth less than the cost of shipping. Sorry. Laughable what sellers call "rare" on eBay.

Deviate slightly and they get upset. @WetDaddy Love it! @benheck Dirty 5: Dawn of the Planet of the Dancing Rises. 5 "Step Up" movies - why??? Let's come up with sequels names had "Footloose" or "Dirty Dancing" gotten to part 5... Well, I think that thing I just wired works. Will know more tomorrow. Stay tuned to the Ben Heck Show! Also, does bacon go bad? @aurich Yes, and expensive. Guess we'll see... :) Stopped at a Big Boy on way back. Love visiting regional restaurants I've never been to. Not sure if any are left! http://t.co/L39s6J8xIF Heading back today. Long drive. Maker Faire Detroit was awesome, will certainly come back in future! @christilongosm @i3Detroit Great to see you again! @rohanswagle No, we are heading back early. Sorry! Cool show though. Maker Faire Detroit is very impressive. Wish I had more time to see everything! Haven't seen one of these in ages! So cool. It molds Oscar Meyer Weiner mobiles. http://t.co/8wvfMGBL96 @RomanAKozak I'm just wondering around with friends. I have a black Ben Heck Show shirts on. Oh yes! Score! I need to find more cash. http://t.co/XpP1xoq4Wz At Maker Faire Detroit. Wonder if anybody has any fordite for sale? @AjGSteelDragon Gotta use them for something! OK this is one of the funkier hotels I've ever been too. Some sort of round ballroom on top. Or UFO. Probably UFO. http://t.co/fzvoXOEbKf Been a long trip, but I didn't think we'd gone this far!

No question, this year I'm finally going! @SeanSimNJ Blew up a cap few years back installed backwards. Electronics usually just smoke if anything. Left, first print @cwkraft and I ever tried. Right, same file printed today on his Maker Gear. http://t.co/PUCev6K6kP http://t.co/5rgLsJ7pg5 my custom Neo Geo MVS. Sold to friend who refurbished for resale - have at it! Wow. I typed the word "License" just as Pandora played an ad against unlicensed work software. Half-Life 3 confirmed! Two week ago Tupperware shop pizza leftovers. If I die eating this, it was good knowing you all. http://t.co/K4054oAPxw Reality show idea: Give contestants a rich daddy for a day, let them make a sex tape, and see who gets the most famous from it. @MintzBuck Cool! I am a Ford guy be near to see. @_ScorpionKing Salvation started too far in future. Intermediate stuff more interesting. Which of course Apes 2 shows, since it's better :) @hackmodford Sure! @Revision3 The games I'd like to see done in HD are new ones. Going to see Dawn of the Apes. Hoping it does right everything Terminator Salvation did wrong. @Leecjr @eevblog Ah yes that was a cool episode! @jgeorge @THEHermanCain @GameroomJunkies Yes the irony is overwhelming. @hackmodford A booty? No, I don't have one of those. I will be wandering around with some friends. @hackmodford I'll certainly be there all day Saturday. Probably not Sunday though. Maybe I'll bring some show T shirts? @shad0wlurkr Um, remote Linux based jukebox? CNC controller (if they have centronix parallel ports) Going to #makerfairedetroit this weekend - anybody else? Have only been to the coastal ones before. @eevblog Someone gave me a Trash 80 this weekend. I think I'll just keep the Z80 from it. @popbumperdk I started with a custom Neo Geo as well. Which coincidentally I am selling this afternoon. @aurich I think you have to be one of those math savants to translate HEX on the fly. @aurich Guy who designed our boards was working on a hacker game that scored in HEX. @benheck Tweet sent after I parked before anyone freaks out. Anybody wanna buy my car? It only has 63 miles on it! http://t.co/rjHjnJKE88 @graboid90 We will have to address that, they clearly didn't have permission nor would I have given it for any political purposes. @popbumperdk Thanks. Counting targets, there's like 13 shots. Not too bad. @three14 Oh that's right! Bill Paxton was in "Groundhog's Day Meets Starship Troopers" as well. @Pgh_Hockey_Dad Thanks for the offer but no. In fact, I prefer to give crap away! @three14 Edge of Tomorrow was the best summer movie everybody I knew wanted to see but nobody did. I have this point, where if something is recommended enough, I avoid it for some reason. Thus I'll never watch House of Cards. @Mad_Bike_Life That game had issues making it unplayable. Thus I did not enjoy it. Movie characters are always cutting ropes to propeller them upwards. Army of Darkness took time to explain visually. http://t.co/7CdJwbCiH0 Long day. Gonna drink beer and watch my new Army of Darkness Blu-ray. And I'm all outta gum! (wrong movie I know thanks) @ILpinballclub Yahoo! We should do a new one soon! @mattjbaldo There is a really nice coffee table book that came out recently I believe it's from Europe. Can't recall the name... @mattjbaldo I've always wondered if I would actually jump from a plane if I went skydiving. I probably would. I'd be like "screw it!" All right. Re-arranged the icons on my laptop and removed some unused programs. Now I am ready to tackle anything. @HistoryInPics @eevblog Yes the Atari 800! Still have mine near my desk at home. Have a great invention to 3D print? Enter this contest I'm helping to judge! http://t.co/njl0KfbYt1 @ChrisFoxMnet Yes! Because if you can invent a better chip clip, the world would beat a path to your door! @bflores We haven't done a multimeter episode? Weird. Id' suggest the best Fluke you can afford, they've never let me down. Why does Photoshop dump every scan into the My Pictures folder? Is there a way to change this default? @bgerein Autodesk 123D @LnghrnEngineer Add coupons and age over 50 to that and it's like 6 people. In a perfect world Paramount would give Star Trek 3 to the creators of Futurama but then it might contain actual sci-fi so it's a long shot. @cwkraft Cygnus? That was the name of the ship in The Black Hole! @kwownoname Banging what? Bill Paxton Pinball on its way to its new home at SS Billiards in the Twin Cities! Take care of it guys! http://t.co/RAr7UUZl1k @Prog98 Yes. Wide screen TV... And nothing else. Unless LA installs rain, phone booths, indoor smoking, newspapers and pedestrians in next 5 years, Blade Runner got the future dead wrong! @Metwinge @element14 Zed X sounds cool but as an American, we just say Zee. @adamdicarlo Be better off laser cutting acrylic. @RoboticMike @ohaifrancy That is an old one! Man I miss that 2008 dashboard! @AbleGamers Over 9000!!! @jimmylipham V-carve. Specifically the ShopBot branded version of it "Partworks" Listen carefully to modern music, there's hardly any verses, just the chorus over and over and over. Lame. http://t.co/0u8HoBEClK has ABS 3D printer filament for a great price! Using some on current project, going to order more because why not? Custom top down spooler. Keeps spools from binding up. Believe what you've read, it's the way to go! http://t.co/b5bzeEtBVE @JonnBlanchard @element14 @zx_spectrum I've wanted to work with one for a long while, just now getting around to it! Could someone calculate the plastic, paper and shipping that will be saved once DVD, Blu-Ray, newspaper and mail are all dead? @MichaelTVWylie @eevblog Penny Arcade did similar thing with the podcast. Plus the potato salad probably won't get delayed! @LadieAuPair @CGSaw @adrishaw I'm taking a break from those controllers at the moment, but will resume building in the fall. @eevblog They're going to mix the salad using a blender powered by Solar Frickin Roadways. Back home and working on a new episode. Vacation's over, 3D printer - get back to work! @KalebPapesh @cwkraft Visit my YouTube page lots of info there! Metric will never take off in America. We measure things in "football fields" for crying out loud! http://t.co/ogSWFBGhdy Heading back home after spending week in Texas. It was fun! Maybe get some final BBQ at airport. @eevblog I tried one of those last fall in New York. Fun! @aurich Probably would have degenerated into self indulgent CGI nonsense. Thank God they never made one! "Too bad they didn't make a sequel to the Matrix" "I know, right? That woulda been awesome!" #realconversation Wait, whoah... World Cup scores seem to be in binary? Now this is a some geeky stuff I can get behind! @KalebPapesh A program by @cwkraft sums the RGB values from the video pixels and divides by 16 to get 16 shades of gray. @chorltonheelies It has (16) 16 bit shift registers that it fills and raster scans fast enough to create an image. @AnnikaOBrien Wait, what matches in this photo? @AnnikaOBrien @alvaroprieto If you want were are basically going for the pinball! @AnnikaOBrien Arriving early, so right at 9. We are going to Joystix in downtown Houston tonight. Pinball + beer = fun, right? @JetFlyerX Yes. Back from the jet ski adventure with my friend @LnghrnEngineer Biggest limitation speed wise is salt water in face. http://t.co/9bufQZmcGP Found an old fossil in the Pacific Northwest. It belongs in a museum! http://t.co/yCLs29c58c @thedesertsong Nah, it happens all the time! Brief trip to Pin A Go Go was fun! Got to play a Kingpin which is pretty rare. Only like 9 in existence. A line for the men's bathroom? #makerfaire is a Smash hit! I'd never met Mighty Ohm before, couldn't resist taking this photo. http://t.co/VpDvjkNXR7 The B17 Bomber. Fast. Stylish. And with machine guns everywhere. Don't tight tail this guy! http://t.co/5stLsU3amm Ridley Scott could make a prequel to his Moses movie and achieve Most Generic Title Ever - "Genesis: Rise of the Beginning" I miss the good old days when there were only 3 sports I had to not give a crap about. Funny sign on board the USS Lexington. It was really fun to move the gun around. http://t.co/FVdV9DautT @AbleGamers 3.5 MHz Super Nintendo could do it, triple core 3 GHz system can't? @AbleGamers Why did console games have remappable controls 20 years ago but rarely today. @ILpinballclub Steve Ritchie in SPAAAAAACCCCEEEEE! Space. Space never changes. http://t.co/9CXHCGgOn5 Ready. Pilot. One. http://t.co/cOqQ3gCaWG Today we are going to @macrofab and then @NASA Totally going to get some Astronaut ice cream. @hungarianhc Smitty's which was 9 billion degrees inside. @Veronica "What is: a way to tax bad taste in movies?" Ran into a young fan of The Ben Heck Show at Smitty's Market in Lockhart, TX. Then ate ribs beer and potato salad. Told someone in Texas "You know nothing about Snow!" but refrained from shooting an arrow in them. Now I am in Houston. Any good pinball here? @Mad_Bike_Life The amount of things on that bike is many! @cwkraft Same here. Starting a new service. Tweet me a situation, and I'll tell you if it's ironic or coincidental, free* of charge! (*internet fees may apply) @dburr "Lead rhymes with dead... COINCIDENCE?" - RoHS Society of America @dburr Yup and Lead rhymes with Dead making it easier to write a theme song. @SmilyBorg Certainly. But when it came to the "boring human filler" Real Steal had a better story with more heart. Pacific Rim 2, huh? I'm gonna lose some geek points here, but I thought Real Steel was a better movie. @tigheklory @trickman @TheRealNimoy @Stan_Bush @Tripredacus @BWTF_Ben That was Orson Welles' last movie fun fact! @trickman @tigheklory @TheRealNimoy @Stan_Bush @Tripredacus @BWTF_Ben You do realize Nimoy did a voice in animated movie AND part 3, right? @Three5Nines That's like being on a lifeboat and saying "Drinking bad saltwater is better than no water at all" @Nokterian Oh I did, I never miss any of their videos. @trickman You saw the best one. Best of the worst I should say. I know why they keep making Transformers movies. The real question is why do people keep going to them? THEY"RE AWFUL! @ridley_john Wow! Remaining filament after 3.5 hour print. Literally down to the wire, right? http://t.co/HmrIiM8R5S @cwkraft It all dates back to the Zune! Just interesting that a design trend started from MS for a change. @ILpinballclub PS3 already has a big giant "Update" button - the power switch. @eevblog Very similar! Original sin (carbon), penance (huge cost), rebirth (ripping up old roads) and blind faith (that it will work) @dh4645 I do! PS3 is the Amazon/Netflix adapter, Xbox 360 is the Mad Men adapter. Neither has been a Games adapters for years now. Oh good Lord does the PS3 really need to update seemingly every week? And take its sweet damn time doing so? @PinballNYC That's an insane collection to be on Route, and T a laundromat??? @aaronabrown Yeah the QTE's took some getting used to. Getting close to end of Tomb Raider (2013) I'm expecting an ironic Twilight Zone ending where she escapes island, dies from infection. @BrianBagnall1 Sure! Better step up your game, Netflix. Amazon Prime has all of the cheesy History Channel reality shows I like. Haven't watched Netflix lately. @BrianBagnall1 Is that the one about the ULA? I'd like to. News today needs to be run through a NOT gate. Google could do it. Take headline, turn ”will not" into "will", etc, boom! Truth. @sloankelly Yes we are doing a ZX Spectrum build this summer. Hand-wiring an 8-bit computer and listening to C64 chiptunes. Because yeah! @Mad_Bike_Life Hey take a break and watch this video! https://t.co/a8xpUeDJwF "The Internet. If you think it, someone's done it" @joehode @eevblog Yup you'll have a giant phone that costs more and does less. @SwiftKickYo Hard to say. Don't pay much if it's broken. @Mad_Bike_Life I disagree. It's actually dumber than you'd expect. @jessepeckham I truly believe films are becoming longer because of that. They don't have to fit a movie in 2 cans (2 hours) anymore. @aurich That's why story in animation is so good - 2 million a minute they're gonna be efficient and make every second count. @MICROmor How about 90 minutes of robots punching each other? Pacific Rim had a lot of "film cheap humans" bloat too. Of all the things wrong with Transformers films, their butt-numbing, hire an f'ing editor length is worst. (New one is 166 minutes??!!!) @eevblog Debunk the modular cell phone idea next! I'd be more excited about No Man's Sky if I thought there was any chance I'd be playing it before 2016. I agree Nintendo should buy Capcom, but that would require them to act like a modern, forward-thinking company. So it'll probably be Amazon. OMG this robot-kid GIF gave me a good laugh this morning! http://t.co/BKU029Sp9a @dwerp595 I don't make portable N64 devices. Too much work. Sorry. Old games on new consoles [because we don't have any new games] trend reminds me of Atari 5200/7800. Got a bad feeling about this... @KalebPapesh Nice work! @GooglePlay I thought that graph was a piece of Fordite for a second! Father/Mother's day is like that Purge movie, where you dare not go out, or heaven forbid try to eat someplace. @ANerdAtHeart Not sure how the math on that one works... Old Tomb Raider was Indiana Jones with a woman, Uncharted was Tomb Raider with a dude, new Tomb Raider is Uncharted with a woman. @wouter0100 I've heard rooting, then installing app to Clear Battery Stats can work. Saw a web ad, assumed it was for Surface, turned out to be iPad Air. Not sure how to feel about that... Good thing these are labeled. Might not be sure otherwise. http://t.co/kPcKf52nBd @ILpinballclub I am probably the only person on earth who considers Hunchback of Notre Dame the best Disney movie ever made. Movies don't have to have kids in them in order for kids to enjoy the movie. (cough cough Jurassic Park series) @Vade_Dave No it cannot. @eevblog Printed replacement extruder clamps, re tightened all bolts once, fixed worn end switch wiring once. Holy cow! That's nearly a month straight of printing! http://t.co/7lrJFuIfzV @modificaconsole Egon was right. Print is dead. "Our console is 10% different from the competitor, and we're going to spend billions to convince you of that!" - gaming industry. Amazon Prime - now streaming all HBO shows except the one you want. @bensawyer Yeah we are at shop 9-5 email me if you wanna stop by! @UltimateBreloom Brave was Pixar, Frozen done by internal Disney. Same parent company, different teams. Screen isn't on. I should inform the protectionist. Oh wait. That job doesn't exist anymore. @eevblog Oh boy! That got there fairly quick. "Frozen" was incredibly average, I feel bad for parents who have to watch it 74 times per week. @Xbox Wait, isn't that where you're supposed to hold the business cards you accumulate? Nintendo E3 predictions: Mario 74, Star Fox 16, Zelda 40, Metroid 32, New IP 0. @WalcomS7 Everything coming from Sony except PS4 is a joke. A setup box that costs more than Apple or Fire TV? No wonder they bleed money. Next-gen won't really start until they stop making concepts compatible with last-gen. Image if Fallout 3 had to have run on PS2 and PS3? Remember the good old days when a game was exclusive because the other console couldn't run it? My E3 prediction: Nobody will admit that this generation of consoles is the last (as we know them) @puppyfarts @redlettermedia I think that pretty much sums it up? Back in Wisconsin, drinking Spotted Cow and watching @redlettermedia Glad that exorbitant cost of air travel helps fund free-to-use iPads for the 0.00% of travelers who don't have one. http://t.co/JFOeaguxdV @jeriellsworth I guess that's a decent excuse! @kwownoname That fat blob TC is still alive? How? @jeriellsworth Hey! You coming to the NW show? Brent Rosenburgh, with a Thingiverse selfie. http://t.co/qFXDxlFsdD Day 2... Or is it 2.5? @nwpinballshow Going to be crowded I bet. PinballBulbs area has a great lineup to play check them out! @ion_ray @nwpinballshow Not sure. Anybody in this area want to give it a good home? @CoderOfThings Start with common values like 10k, 4.7k, 1k, 75 and 100, and branch out from there @tida1wav3 Nice one! But isn't Maleficent already the remake? I don't think the placement of this numeral is a coincidence. Encoded message perhaps? http://t.co/v5A5C6scJu Disney has an edict, only single word, non-feminine titles for movies. Wonder what their live action Cinderella will get changed to? Shoes? Now I am in Seattle for the NW Pinball Show. I am going to tilt all the games. Hahaha. Have seen two things I never have before at MSP airport - a woman having her shoes shined, and a Surface tablet being used! @eevblog Those cameras might seem like a joke now, but they were the BEES KNEES back in the 90's. BTW I'll be attending the NW Pinball Show this weekend, if you have any questions about America's Most Haunted. http://t.co/VLfoRXc0jL @jmtenny @terrenceisdaman Worst part for me is sitting through the literal 20 minutes of crap before the movie even starts. Great. Now I have the song "Private Eyes" stuck in my head, all thanks to... hm... well, guess it was my own fault. @terrenceisdaman Place near me hiked Matinee prices to $10! It was 6.50 just a few years ago. Hey Hollywood! Maybe films would make more $$$ if you didn't release them all in May with no room to breathe? (Also, if they didn't suck) @eevblog Whip around the sun in a captured Klingon wessel to get one from 1986. Look, let's just make 8-Bit Pixelated Bacon Zombie Adventures, get it over with, then actually find some new pop culture trends, OK? @cwkraft You shouldn't have to. The FTDI chip should handle that. Maybe there's a command you need to send via USB? @sonicase Really? That's insane. You'd freeze to death at that altitude. But don't take my word for it! Reading Rainbow was awesome and all, but upon analysis of the theme song, going twice as high as a butterfly isn't that impressive. People might use more secure passwords than "password" or "packers" if they weren't expected to remember 30-40 different ones! @benheck Wanted to watch Wreck-It Ralph and Frozen so I know WTF my friends with kids are talking about. Can't even rent Ralph? 2 years old! Noticing a trend where you can't rent movies off Xbox/Amazon, only "buy" digital copies? I rarely watch a (new) movie more than once. @ILpinballclub I have no interest in that title. Ironically, when streaming replaces TV, content will be spread over so many services subscribing to them all will be as expensive as cable. @ahicktiger You should see Escape from Castle Wolfenstein on my Atari 800! @tigheklory @StitcherRadio I don't know what that is. It's on iTunes I think. Looks like the malware problem is resolved on my site. Did you know we're doing monthly podcasts again? http://t.co/smaqc1eRGV @Pew446 You shall have to wait and see! @stoneymonster I have latest AMD drivers. Still BSOD's every so often. Enjoying Wolfenstein: New Order on PC (one man army fightin' Nazis YEAH!) but getting lots of BSOD - anybody else? @LnghrnEngineer Must be! Waxing really brings put the door dings and chips, you know. Ug, forgot how tedious hand waxing a car was. Oh well. No choice but to finish it. Spotted Cow break? Worked in theater as a teen. We hated "credit watchers" since they delayed our cleaning. Must be much worse with all these super hero films. @eevblog Giiiiive Meeeeee Genesis! Yes, I know my website got infected with malware. It has been cleaned from the PHP, but will probably still be blocked. @PinSoul Exactly! (Probably about 8 hours + 2 testing) @element14 @EpilogLaser We call it "LASER PAINT!" Cleaning with rubbing alcohol before etching helps a lot we discovered. @jeriellsworth Make a RR bodysuit and project a different person onto it! Could spice of the lives of bored couples. @Dev_Enthusiast The PHP got hacked. We're working on it. @LnghrnEngineer That's the kind of race nobody wins. Didn't grab hot sauce at Taco Bell, using the packets from my fridge. You're welcome, planet. @HydroThunder34 Sorry I'm more into getting rid of stuff than obtaining it. Thanks for the offer though. @ILpinballclub @LnghrnEngineer Just like every videogame still sounds like Atari 2600 Pac-Man in movies. @RoyEltham @LnghrnEngineer Steve Ritchie would say "FLIRT BETTER!!!" @aspetdav Sitting on a shelf. Up for sale I guess! Some analysis firm should compute how many programmer-hours were wasted in 2014 on Flappy Bird clones. This solder extruder arm I'm designing looks like a Lego flintlock pistol. http://t.co/svI2P6U5Lo On the Ben Heck Show, we eat at our desks and work through lunch... so work can come to a screeching halt for the 2 PM Pinball Break. Laudium bottles, lunch boxes, NES game boxes... Wonder what we're throwing away now that'll be worth money in 30 years? @tigheklory You seen the prices on Castlevania 4 lately? WTF? @eevblog In a Randy Travis movie? With no cell kill switch law yet, glad I made it back from CA without my Castlevania code falling into wrong hands! http://t.co/QfRYDNaN7A Expendables 3 going PG-13 to "expand audience"... Because so many 15-year-olds care about senior citizen action stars from the 80's? @cwkraft You are lucky. Our flight was so delayed we had to switch Airlines. Weather wasn't so bad. Great #makerfaire weekend! But thing I'm most looking forward to when I get back? Hydration. @ParallaxKen Oh yeah, no problem! I just used the DAC program from our pinball machine We have a couple Ben Heck Show shirts left. If you see me and want one, let me know. @bluesaunders @woodywoodrell We asked that of course. It just kinda sits there. You have to sign the wall manually. Amazing factory. Thanks to @woodywoodrell for the tour. And I didn't even steal anything :) http://t.co/Agxt7Sfbsu Visiting the Tesla Motors plant in Fremont, CA. Very cool stuff! @worldofglenn I'm gonna tilt all the games! Heading up to Pin A Go Go. Because why not? Ask me anything about America's Most Haunted! @hackaday Where is the party at? @natethegreat158 PSVita to PS4 with remote play @thejamiehood They are actually Ben Heck Show shirts. #makerfaire tip: Eat as soon as you arrive before food lines form. Arrived at #makerfaire Yahoo! Say hi and we can hook you up with a shirt. Great thing about #makerfaire is you'll be talking about a person's project one minute, run into the actual person the next! @jessiewonka I dunno. I'm pretty tired. Traffic around SF seems above average. Or should I say below average? Pretty bad. Just shot a surface mount rework demo using minimal parts at Rev3. Copper wire as solder braid! @aurich @Mad_Bike_Life Depends on what's all going on. Some of my friends are going. Might be a long shot for me. Just landed in SFO. @Mad_Bike_Life is here too. Maker Faire! 3D printed this secondary microphone radio mount in time for #makerfaire Seems appropriate! http://t.co/5eemODqRot @_s1500_ Page isn't complete but go for it: http://t.co/coeHFRFPrW New X-Men movie budget: $250 million. Amount spent on poster design: $3.50. God it's terrible looking. Still gonna see it. Excited to get out to Bay Area for #makerfaire Seems like everyone else is there already. Need some movie rentals for flight... Movie going advice: If a trailer for a comedy has a scene of people laughing, the movie won't be funny. @LnghrnEngineer Go in! @ArcadeHunters Is that Joe's game? Good moves by MS for XB1. The Gold Required for Netflix thing was especially dumb considering how many other devices can run it. @DanAmrich Cool! Hope we run into you! @TheJonesCode @t0eknee It was! Conspiracy! @TheJonesCode @t0eknee In context of 1969, the spoof would be fresh. In context of 2014, we've seen it a billion times before. In an otherwise great episode, found the 2001 reference in Mad Men a bit jarring. That's sitcom material, come on! Looking forward to Maker Faire trip. Also, making generic version of my pinball code so people can write their own games for my PCB. @eevblog @hpux735 @element14 Would still like to make the toy actually educational if you had time to record new lines. @jeriellsworth That's a nice place but usually crowded. You might want to make a large reservation to clear some space. @Jon_Diaz I won't be in town until Friday, sorry! @Chris_Gammell @cwkraft @DylanPalme so it has to survive baggage as well? Ouch. @ahicktiger Gee, I can't argue with inflation! Where do I send my money? @ahicktiger Wow! What a great price! So I'm thinking flop game, copies ordered destroyed, shrink wrapped, these will be worth something in 10 years. http://t.co/rFEeAiWD3w @Chris_Gammell @cwkraft Of course! A Pelican case is a great idea. @cwkraft @Chris_Gammell Maybe you'd open Pelican sideways, like a book, and surfaces fold out from inside. @brianjfuller Yes we will! Going to take my mom and sister to lunch for Mother's Day, but first, finishing my Attack From Mars custom rule cards. Have a documentary idea - kinda like Super-Size Me, but it's a person playing through their Steam backlog. Title ideas? Acquired a Dreamcast at the Video Game X Change South of where I live. Hm... @Pesoen This is probably as cheap as it gets: http://t.co/Mm3UareKpt Was going to order some material sorting boxes, then realized "I have a laser cutter and loads of scrap cardboard!" http://t.co/Ehq7kYsTBq Editing a video showing our pinball's Bluetooth Test Mode, then going to sort my pile of laserable materials. @pdp7 @eevblog @TheAmpHour @Chris_Gammell OK! I'd like to remake it educational with electronic symbols / photos and Dave calls them out. Wow. Playing a Meatloaf song really gets Furby dancing. Who would have guessed? http://t.co/FnlWJKBIu2 San Mateo restaurants! Want to make OVER 9000 dollars? Host the #BringAHack geek dinner next Sunday evening.

We've never seen that. @jeriellsworth @pdp7 @SophiKravitz @j_jwalrus @mightyohm @EMSL @Chris_Gammell @JacGoudsmit @laen @macegr I vote someplace with better food. @LnghrnEngineer @RoyEltham @cwkraft I still want to make a game where someone wanders around an abandoned hospital chased by ghosts. @LnghrnEngineer @RoyEltham @cwkraft What about that new Wolfenstein thing? @dfdx2 Two or three. I was also explaining to Felix how switch matrixes worked. @antshockey Yup I take a photo too. Just in case! @Jay2theWho @lab317 I didn't build that NES. $500 isn't a lot in the grand scheme of collecting. We don't erase the whiteboard until it becomes completely full. http://t.co/2p7Blpgvix @TheJonesCode It's times like these... you must remember the awesome game MS gave to the world.... LIPS! @cwkraft Octoprober! @TheJonesCode @Xbox @MadMen_AMC @AMC_TV This has happened with other seasons as well, including Breaking Bad. @TheRyanAdams yes America's Most Haunted has just started production. @TheRyanAdams Too much work. Been a literal second job for me last 15 months. @TheRyanAdams Great idea for a theme! I'm getting out of the business however. @TheJonesCode @Xbox @MadMen_AMC @AMC_TV I know, right? This isn't how you win a console war. @cwkraft I would bet good money on "Rise of the Jedi" or "A New Beginning" May 4th, so did we get an Epiosde 7 title yet? I'll be very impressed if it doesn't use the word "Rises" I hate diving in and out of folders constantly to find things - takes forever. Why can't Windows fix that, instead of adding touch controls. @sbloom85 Can't recall. Believe they were the very common 14MM "skate" bearings. Autocorrect needs a setting: "Don't constantly predict political figures when I type common first names" @eevblog Yes it's too bad WordPress doesn't have Facebook login for comments. @UCFH Not much, since that game already exists. Turns out this switch matrix display I'd be dreading to write only took about 15 minutes including plot command. Hm. http://t.co/hWsigTfQFk Hey anyone have a laptop at the Allentown pinball show? The local vendor with our AMH game could use some technical help. Science channel should make a crime procedural called "Ohm's Law" - currently the high voltage show you can't resist! @Zittware @PINCADIA I'm done building them, yes. @ILpinballclub PF must be exactly 45" long for it to fit. Plus we aren't quite done with it yet. @tim1986 AMH is my last game. Too much work for too little reward. Plus I don't want to make licensed games, and that's all the buyers want. I'm torn. Should I cathartically smash my pinball rotisserie, or give it to a local pinhead who could make use of it? Holy cats this channel is amazing! https://t.co/w5Jns1AH7y @LnghrnEngineer @jeriellsworth Digital Dial calipers? UGH! http://t.co/CU0wzE4sPt It made the trip safely, good to here! First one out of state via freight. @AngryFoxBrewing Nice! My coat still has dog hairs from that episode. If you could pick one media trend to just die already, which would it be: Superhero movies or Zombies? @_Z__ @jeriellsworth I will be, yes. @PPR98 Very car. Much fast. Wow. Here is the string cheese brand. You're welcome, Internet. http://t.co/QOYslr0J2T This smoked string cheese I packed with my lunch is well above average. I shall have to take note of the brand when I get home tonight. @jeriellsworth Those belong in a museum! @Cheesemeister3k The real treasure would be any prototype systems they find. @Microsoft I'd love to bring a landfill 2600 back to life Whomever "owns" those Atari carts they're pulling out of the desert has a GOLDMINE on their hands for collector resale. After 2 months, got my Attack from Mars back, with the triple-cleared new Micro playfield. It's time to Return to Battle, Soldier! @kobunheat @RaymeCVinson Those Atari cartridges would probably still work. They have to plug one in and try it. Some Hollywood exec probably saw my tweet and thought "Hey! That's a much better name than National Treasure Rises we were going with!" @triptrish It'll be like Benjamin Franklin took a secret trip to China or something, buried a giant golden battery. When (not if) they make National Treasure 3, I would bet large sums of money it'll be called "International Treasure" @JadarDev Yes! I know they exist, just wish I had one. So much ABS over the years I could have turned into filament... $35 for "Final Season" of Mad Men. But isn't it split in half? Didn't this cause a ruckus with Breaking Bad, or did I buy both halves. Some might say being superstitious is stupid. I disagree. It's stupid NOT to be superstitious! I love stupid programming mistakes. They're much easier to fix than problems you can't figure out. Finished Code &gt; Pride Completely by accident, this temp SFX and game action in AMH reminds me of Mega Man - I'm leaving it in! @MNeko I had it once. It was awful. Oh boy, I finally own a rare game without realizing it! (untill now) Sunset Riders on SNES. Contra + Rolling Thunder + Old West. Great port! @thomasloven My mom buys me new gloves every other winter, so I've got a collection of pairs I never wear. Goodwill? Turns out AMH Tilt recovery wasn't fully functional at MGC, nobody noticed. Haha. Going through every mode now making sure. My leather gloves from Wilson's just completed their 16th winter. No bad seams, and just a little wear under thumbs. http://t.co/z5v6Qy6amr @SabrinaD @Mad_Bike_Life I was concentrating on the road! :) No shop pet yet. Maybe a fish. Forgot to tweet this, America's Most Haunted won "Best Custom Game" at Midwest Gaming Classic 2014! http://t.co/04PjldGbv9 If there's one thing Xbox does unquestionably better than PlayStation, it's purchased video streaming. @kujaeast Yeah just slice the red five volt wire in the cable. @cwkraft Weigh the object then calculate against cost of spool. Time is biggest cost. Steve Ritchie did his Mortal Kombat voice for me - sweet! Remember how big the Atari 5200 was? Ever wonder how large a carrying case for it be? The answer is this. http://t.co/QClwk0j6zW @ArcadeWorks VERY nice work on the Neo Geo keep it up! Oh no its Steve Ritchie! He had some good advice at last year's MGC that was helpful. http://t.co/YPSPBu7crm Sheraton bathroom garbage cans had to be designed to also hold booze and ice - couldn't be a coincidence. http://t.co/fUtfbWNJ9z @tigheklory Sure it's just an array of variables for each switch. Decreased debounce on AMH pops and now they're insane! So fast, I should increase # it takes to light a mode / reduce jackpot increment. @Nickiankohler Correction the only thing I can do well while drunk is video editing. @tanioklyce You survived the winter! Yes stop on by! @woody24 lure over friends with beer and pizza @Mad_Bike_Life Haha there are MANY games here! Arrived at Midwest Gaming Classic. Setting up games, doing code flash for slight rule change on multiball (makes jackpot collect easier) @ruttencutter No mine isn't from DeForest. @GJamesBerigan @lifehacker Haha yes! Nice workmanshop! Cut dowels to roll TOM into my station wagon. Worked great! I should build a custom loader sometime. http://t.co/FwepMlwNbq @tigheklory It's also amazing how many artists are connected to Queen, apparently. @kwownoname @Mad_Bike_Life No it's just a normal sized poodle. Or as I would call it, a Super Poodle. Pandora is interesting. When it puts a face with a song, unlike radio, you realize Sara Bareilles pretty much sings everything. @ILpinballclub Yep. Has finished Pf and plastics too not just Whitewood. Surprise. Why did I buy this giant sandwich? Will eat as much as I can to avoid waste. http://t.co/6MhWWyYnjX https://t.co/CHNHbToBDh Check out the Spooky Pinball Showcase! America's Most Haunted and Pinball Zombies both playable. @michaeljnelson Your overreacting. @kwownoname We would need an entire LOAF of bread to fit a picture of your cat. @kwownoname I can just stick bread in my laser and raster cook it. Would be pretty slow though... Eating every meal at my shop this week. Note to Hormel: If your microwave chicken BBQ tastes like an MRE, go back to the drawing board. @nthdesign Word, brother! Used INT where I should have used Unsigned Char. There goes 2 hours of my life I'll never get back. Sigh. http://t.co/wVmy4IeALE Because I kept thinking during BSG "If only this were a safe, big budget, 2.5 hour long movie starring teenagers" @kwownoname I don't have a toaster in my shop. @AbleGamers you will wonder how you lived without it, the true sign of an great invention. @tigheklory Used to have lots. Most gone. Still one on the side of Madison. They used to have awesome breakfast. I can count how many days/nights I've worked straight in the shop by counting wrappers from the Arby's a block away - it's like tree rings! @TheJonesCode For the night is dark and filled with spiders who always pay you back the Blood Price. @TheJonesCode It's THE name is Dalton not His! Just realized Dalton in "Road House" didn't have a first or last name. Mind. Blown. @bobrocks79 That is awesome! I will have to get my grabby paws on one of those! @hoosjon Yes it was good! I stopped coding for 2.25 hours (or 2.75 hours with trailers and ads) to see Captain America 2. Coulda used more Cobie Smulders. The North Face - Choose from matching his &amp; her sets in many colors like black, burned black, charcoal black, noir black and light black. "It might be cold walking from your Lexus RX 350 in the unheateed parking garage to the airport terminal. The North Face has you covered!" I'm glad we, as a nation, got over the whole trend of "has-been singer singing over a Carlos Santana guitar background" trend. @TheJonesCode No wonder games get released with unfinished code. I can actually feel my life force draining away. Working far too many hours. But damn, is America's Most Haunted gonna be polished! @tigheklory @Phetishboy that thing is a beauty! @tigheklory @Phetishboy Yep we are bringing it. The mode debug sheet for America's Most Haunted. I have 7 days to get everything to Done &amp; Working http://t.co/ULWAgPVuIO Is Al Gore really that busy that he can't start a band called the Algorythms? Have a feeling flight MH370 going into the mysterious legend books along with Amelia Earhart, Flight 19, and the Mary Celeste. @daveinsaini I still have most of it. Old place I lived, recorded the cool sounds of the spring-loaded sliding windows before I left. Using it in my ghost pinball game! @Aeroengineer1 In San Jose? We were there last year, how is this show? @RaymeCVinson I'm trying to catch up on Netflix. What's a good stopping point? @mattjbaldo How about Ouya-Slayer? @mattjbaldo Well, you use kindling to kindle a fire, so fire is the evolution of kindle, I guess. Maybe PRIMEBOX? @Aeroengineer1 Not unless it was at a Red Robin or the UPS store, no. My first reaction to Amazon Fire TV, after "Why?" was "Sure you want a consumer electronics device for the home to include the word "Fire"? @gl33p @sector67 Getting fired. One more code flash, then I'll go home. Story of my life. This is the last for the evening, I swear it. Got my coat on, that'll work. Mega64 shows a new spin on the console wars! https://t.co/E8GNUhLa31 RT @LnghrnEngineer: @MacroFab is hiring! Looking for a Lead UI Dev and a Marketing/Community Manager. More info in the link. https://t.co/4… @ILpinballclub $48 the first week. Went into bar to update our pinball on location, the guy playing it had driven 1.5 hours to check it out. Cool stuff! @bitblackout When Michael shoots the guy from Office Space, stop watching. @bitblackout Seasons 6 and 7 Netflix needs star ratings per TV season. When something goes completely off the rails, like Burn Notice, you know when to stop watching @Tweetn2You @element14 From our tests, a PC rarely draws that much. Non-gaming around 200 watts, 500 gaming. My Reddit AMA is inbound! http://t.co/h2NvEO6wNe I've got a Reddit AMA this afternoon. Stop by and have a chat! Warning I am easily Distracted off topic! @LetterToMyBrain looks like a cool product! @dasbacon @PAPApinball Maybe we can set something up at MGC? The good cameras are in my shop, production AMH games in different shop! @dasbacon I threw in on their Kickstarter. Ironically, I haven't watched their videos lately. @cwkraft What did you get? @tomsliwowski I'm just not going to design/build them anymore. And get my collection down to one - super nice AFM. When I retire from pinball, I can do things like enjoy cooking again. Observe my Pac Man Cornbread! Very pinteresting http://t.co/VTQZlLj5Cq @xert77 There are over 100 videos, check 'em out and thanks for watching! @JillScharr I have the original 2012 model Makerbot Replicator. Enjoying Titanfall and its great gameplay balance. Battlefield should take note and reduce armor spawns by about 60% or make you earn armor. @Two__Tone I don't have a Wii to test it on. But you can always email me via http://t.co/j1nz9ZJkGw @Supercolor @caricevhouten It would be a cool theme. "On location, this machine always pays its debts!" @BigNigMac Oh sure! Gamecube portable, Dreamcast portable. LOST pinball machine. No dinner until I figure out what's wrong with this EEPROM read! That'll motivate me, right? Lame thing about programming is to get X to work you often have to do ABC first. So progress often goes backwards. Oh well. @Its_Finlay Look into CP/M Years later, I am downloading that Ghostbusters game to my Xbox 360. Was always curious about it. Not getting disc because print is dead. First AMH is on location, in a bar, on a Friday night. "Let's see what happens!" http://t.co/wXGjQepzmL @sloankelly I acquired one recently. @brianmpreston yes but we believe a fixed solution will be faster and allow more fluid filming. Installing new lights in the shop today. Soon it will be brighter than the sun. Making a credits list for the Wizard Mode of America's Most Haunted. Hope I don't miss anybody. @timryderhome Nice! ToTAN can be hard to find. @tigheklory yes and 100 would take the same number of bacon pieces as 88 @thestudcomic Yeah, probably. Tried to write out my age in Denny's bacon, only got halfway. http://t.co/yVlJysYhmL @carlwatkins Maybe Inkscape? There's also A free CAD program but I can't recall the name. @AceMilo I think that was more of a stream than a pond. But maybe, in some infinite other universe? @GiraldAlbert They would probably say "There's a lot less stuff piled on it than last year!" Does whomever did this AMD update graphic realize that's Elizabeth from like 10 versions of "Infinite" ago? http://t.co/1aXJCG1mFa @frankhaugen We did something like that on an episode, two heads printing same object at once I cleaned off the water heater. Now we can stack things on it! http://t.co/UasL5vCPXX @jgiles14 Yeah that's about right. History channel always runs shows like Decoding The Pyramids. Need one here, Decoding Ben's Shop's Electrical. Finally giving Titanfall a try. Looks fun! @Bertholomey @element14 Probably later in April. I need to finish up some projects before I can take on new work. I, "ace" programmer, have variables "multiball" AND "multipleBalls" in my pinball code. Good thing it's well commented! As a result of Need for Speed's failure, studios will only greenlight 47 more videogame movies this week instead of 78. @BamBamokie01 Yeah like all of media, it seems to be becoming more and more for kids. 20 minutes to update PS3, another 10 to update Netflix, and I'm no longer on the mood to select from 9500 different reality shows. The #PS4 accessibility controller is one of my most requested mods, and you can see it Friday at @element14: http://t.co/3XH9t4wkWp @kisaragi_chan Sure! We are always looking for cool new ideas! @LnghrnEngineer @cwkraft Imagine how quickly you could open pickle jars! @biffstix Of course. Unless I die from exhaustion trying to finish America's Most Haunted. We are fast approaching a binary singularity where Hollywood makes nothing but superhero movies and CGI animated films. @LnghrnEngineer @cwkraft Where? @LnghrnEngineer @cwkraft When does the golden stream begin? @dirtydave0221 Yes stopMusic() just does a immediate fade, so they all end up in same place. Might not be stopping the DAC properly. Think I've narrowed down the fatal bug in my AV kernel to the stopMusic() or fadeMusic() command. Getting closer... @LnghrnEngineer Woo-hoo! Now to finish programming it! Pinball programming day. Getting tilt drain, extra ball, other "housekeeping" stuff like that all working and ready. @_Z__ Oh yes I quite enjoyed it. I even like black and white movies! @element14 On this week's episode of The Ben Heck Show, we go to extremities! Finally left a note for upstairs neighbor who works nights - when he's not around, his alarm goes off for hours every evening. Argh! Netflix "Best Guess For Ben" 3.3 stars for Hunchback of Notre Dame? I friggin' love that movie, try again computer algorithms! @Mad_Bike_Life presents new Steampunk Breathe-Rite Strips! http://t.co/grpWkzgKgr At the rate they're going, in a few years they'll be a Batman game called "Arkham World 2: The Arkhaming - An Arkham Tales Adventure" @Kevlar_X Spider-Man 2, the best superhero movie ever. Period. The power of the sun... In the palm of my hand! http://t.co/cCe1pxd5wo @cwkraft Saturn was pretty lame. @tomsliwowski It did fine but they made a bunch of stupid decisions with it (cartridges mostly) to help their bottom line, not developers. Has a game company every avoided Third Console Hubris? Maybe Atari, who blew it on their second try? Oscars are like the Super Bowl if the winner was decided 3 months earlier based off how many Super Bowls they hadn't won in the past. Hey look what I pulled out of an old arcade cabinet! http://t.co/rgkUun87ZN @Beardy Rusty finished up school and took a job on the other side of town. @jay_sherby @playouya Yes. Still, people wanted to see us do this project. Oh man... Go a few months without eating Chinese and you loose your tolerance to getting Wanged or whatever they call it. @flippedbauxite Riggs!!!!!! @LnghrnEngineer I promise to stop making changes! Sorting out a junky shelf. Taking all the junk and putting it in a different pile = progress! @ProModz They will. But if any film belongs stuck in the 80s it's that one. We're nostalgic for an era of original film concepts &amp; great soundtracks. Hollywood mistakes this for "Oh they want 80's films remade!" @BRV64 44780 itself (what the LCD uses) much more common and plenty of libraries. Takes 7 pins but it "just works" SPI to LCD = hacky. @BRV64 WTF is that? Some sort of serial to 44780 adapter? @tigheklory It's going to be called "Possumus Men" and it's still several years away. I don't watch Oscars. It's just millionaires handing awards to other millionaires for their portrayal of dead millionaires. @Ribbedkilla Westbound and down! Load it up and truck it! There aren't nearly enough movies with the premise of "beer transport" anymore @xxrxndxvxs AH!!! Well mine doesn't fold up I'm afraid. @xxrxndxvxs Someone at Chicago expo had a folding machine. Skill Shot pinball I think they called themselves? Single? Order HBO, announce that you have it on a dating site, and find a mate by April 6th, 2014 GUARANTEED! Call now! @xxrxndxvxs That's a long way to haul a game! But Chuck did discuss doing at least one "remote" show at some point. (Texas is too soon)

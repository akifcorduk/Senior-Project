Learning how to sort, rotate 3d models, etc.  Very cool stuff. @eyeruol Well I'd argue coding *is* creative..but I agree :) - "Neural Programmer / Interpreter" type approaches already making progress Eg hand-coding rules of how to dance vs showing the system a bunch of motion-cap data of someone dancing and learning how to do it Earlier approaches were akin to a decision tree with randomness. Newer approaches can "encode human creativity" by training on real examples Algorithmic content gen has been used in games for years.  Stuff like SpeedTree.  But trainable generative systems are *different* Oh and let's not forget music.  RNNs can generate jazz, irish folk songs, etc. These systems can already generate textures, 3d walking gaits, stories, dialog, ... We're starting to automate creativity itself! #cognitive Fast forward a few years in generative AI and we'll see it powering all sorts of @NoMansSky type games via on-the-fly content synthesis AlchemyAPI, Orbeus, Metamind, LookFlow, MadBits, Jetpac.. everyone getting acquired! Soon there won't be any deep learning startups left :) Elevation changes while walking (which @NoMansSky has lots of) are weird in VR. Teleporting is the "fix", but doesnt map into NoMansSky well People keep saying @NoMansSky will be great for VR but i'm not so sure.

We can discuss guns and drum 'n bass (I love DnB and no i'm not being sarcastic) @DReyOne1 You poor little thing, you give up so easily!  #haveagreatday @DReyOne1 Stellar grammar btw. "Are your retarded".  haha.  You're really proving my point here, lol @DReyOne1 Great job using "retarded", a slur against the mentally disabled.  Are you getting frustrated with my facts and evidence? lol @DReyOne1 No, i'm saying 911 calls about psychos walking around in public with rifles won't be ignored. @DReyOne1 But again, that's a pesky fact right? @DReyOne1 "Noah Harpham was spotted openly carrying a rifle before he killed 3 in Colorado Springs" -- calls to 911 ignored. @DReyOne1 I guess stopping the mass shooting 3 weeks ago in your town wouldn't have been good enough? https://t.co/kW3AzsU8jh @DReyOne1 Again you're equating open carry with a total ban on guns.  They aren't the same.  But I know, that's a pesky fact.  #greatjob @DReyOne1 So you're equating wearing a pistol on your belt in public with "outlawing all guns"?  Good job on the slippery slope there, haha. @DReyOne1 Gun problems can always be solved with more guns.  Just keep telling yourself that.  It'll all be OK.  lol @DReyOne1 So I guess the 3 cops who were shot were unarmed?  Never mind those pesky facts though, right? Colorado needs to outlaw open carry.  It's absolute insanity. https://t.co/kW3AzsU8jh Shame to hear about domestic terrorism in Colorado Springs today. https://t.co/shcjCT2PNe RT @Sci_Phile: So just add some crosses and it breaks my brain.

Hope to see you at the next one! It's great tech though. My company's lab is very excited to play with the upcoming #googleglass GDK + build some #nlproc + speech + AR apps. But those aside, I honestly question the value-add of this sort of AR technology for most normal consumers.  The killer app isn't there yet Lots of practical issues however: inability to fold like normal glasses, wonky speechrec, fairly quiet bone conduction spkr, buggy firmware I've recorded dozens of incredible videos w/ my 2 year-old w/ #googleglass -- stuff that would have been impossible to get otherwise For certain niche areas (aircraft mechanics, etc) #googleglass will be great.  It's also fantastic for parents of young children After using it for a week, I honestly have a hard time seeing #googleglass in its current form making it as a mainstream consumer device So I've spent a week messing with #googleglass -- here's my assessment:  Really interesting tech.  Not ready for prime time *at all* Good #DOCC this morning -- love the new venue (Galvanize.it) -- nice seeing some folks such as @msitarzewski who I haven't seen in a while For me, one of the most interesting areas in computer vision right now is: Semantic Scene Parsing / Labeling haha, my 2 year-old daughter just said "ok glass" #googleglass Just picked up #googleglass -- at SFO on way back to Denver RT @danbri: watched http://t.co/1GgGoK77Et 'Computers versus Common Sense' Doug Lenat tech talk from 2006 (on Cyc etc.); worth the 1h...

Tell that to everyone on the EAL7 / CC vendor lists @SethGrimes BTW we're above 32,000 now -- need to update these stats on the website @SethGrimes It's forbidden by our ToS and customer MSA and we've refused numerous requests to integrate into network monitoring systems For the record: @AlchemyAPI does not work with companies or govts doing surveillance.  Sadly some other companies do. (You know who you are) Today's systems incorporate #nlproc technology with network tapping + surveillance to analyze emails/chats/etc -- *far* beyond keywords We explicitly forbade using our system for warrantless surveillance.. did not sell to foreign govts - most vendors made no such restrictions In 1995 my last company released one of the very first commercially-avail. NIDS deep packet inspection products, SecureNet Pro..18 years ago Widespread electronic surveillance has sadly been the norm for far more than a decade.  Anyone remember the FBI's "Carnivore"?

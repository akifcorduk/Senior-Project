She is pushing things through apparently. Reminds me I need a crap at some juncture. I am suddenly intimately informed of the business of a lady from Celtic Manner as she makes a call inches from my left ear. I see a lady’s face reflected in the window. The face convulses and coughs. Presumably germs are also reflected off the glass towards me. I  must admit for a tenner I’d want that filled with vodka. The same company makes a product called “Critical Oats” and these powders in huge bottles used by people who make their bodies look odd. I looked it up online and it’s a bottle of water that costs a tenner. Jesus. They have the fanciest bottle of water I have ever seen. It had an atom logo on it and everything. Lady behind coughs a deep, bubbling cough and orders a Twix from the unexpected trolly. I don’t know what Under Armour actually is, apart from what cricketers wear down below. He’s off much to the relief of my retinas. Table seat opposite invaded by foreign couple clad in Under Armour logos. Maybe he’ll get off at Reading. Nobody Welsh would have a coat like that. Look at that yellow. My poor glazzies. https://t.co/BRR7i0Ru57 Chap on the table opposite has hair on top but then shaven all around from forehead height.  Makes him look a bit like a bar stool. DEAR GOD BLOW YOUR NOSE MAN I can smell his crisps too and it’s not blending at all well with the smell of Red Bull. I can smell his Red Bull. I’d prefer the smell of a real one. 🐂 Either he’s had too much cocaine or I am going to get a cold He is eating crisps. While(crisps){crunch,sniff}; I am on the train. In table seat. Guy diametrically opposite has violent yellow coat and is sniffing once every ten seconds. I’m cream crackered.

Too rainy to walk to the curry house. @NineLeavez mind you in my favourite proper London boozer sub £3 pints are normal so it depends where you go In the pub down the road from my hotel. £4.50 a pint of London Pride.

We should start a Mannerless Musk Ox club. For those who are worthy. 🐂 @mgreen the surfaces you fly over are “tiles”, although they can be other things too they are logically tiles. It’s not just about the ox. 🐂 If you love Polybius remember without the musicians it wouldn’t sound as good. Without Giles’ backend work there’d be no 120hz smoothness. @JimMcCauley yeah I know. So happy to see it. Part of me still scared that somehow it’ll be snatched away. It’s been a journey. Keeping an eye out for hinoxen. https://t.co/0aFXbW3LDr Skies like BOTW out here. Skylarks singing. Such peace only a mile from one of the world's busiest airports. https://t.co/3gK6AAF5Yh Anyway time for me to stick on some Daft Punk and stumble the mile back to the hotel. 

Still kind of shell-shocked to tell you the truth. @pete_mccarthy yeah I still can’t quite believe it.My reactive mind had convinced me everyone would hate it. I’m in a kind of daze right now I am in the pub. 🍺 I had a chicken achari. Mispronounced it as chicken Atari when I ordered. 🐂 Ooh I am as full as an ox. 🐂 Oh yeah 😃👌🐂 https://t.co/U9cEu4CB7Y @mgreen awaiting level sequencer startup, does it clear?

Luckily the carriage is sparsely populated and they aren’t very deadly. I am farting on the Tube.

Spotted some trainspotters at Didcot Parkway. People on the train probably wondering why that hairy bloke with wonky eyes who smells of cattle is grinning at his iPhone 6. 🐂 And I’m smiling on the train again 😃🐂 https://t.co/Z4wfs7vKJs The lady doing the announcing is talking about sandwiches. I am at the home of Amazing Frog. I  have yet to play Amazing Frog. 🚨Cheesy Wotsits busted out on the table opposite 🚨 @anosou that was indeed brilliant. 🐂 @MrBastounis the Llamasoft musicians! https://t.co/jmtITFKbS8 @NineLeavez they also serve Purple Moose beer which goes great with the sandwiches. Moose juice. @NineLeavez mustard optional, great bread, plenty of butter, big thick ham slices and a small bowl of crisps to go with. 👌 @avon_deer kind of slimy, and not in the good way. The LED board at Bristol Parkway says only PLEASE REFER TO TIMETABL. @refreshgamesuk believe me the video doesn’t convey even a tenth of it 😃 I  pointedly extend my hooves into the previously inappropriately occupied legroom as he departs. Chap opposite is departing at lovely Bristol Parkway. I am in Theresa May’s England. As a Polybius co-creator I think it’s only appropriate that I am seated near the emergency glowsticks in this train carriage. My scrolling is a bit jittery. I hope my touchscreen’s not on the knacker. Giles just called me to tell me there is no news. Bloke opposite’ knee just brushed mine. Perhaps now he will understand  the need for optimal occupancy of a table seat. OK. Now I am craving the ham sandwiches at Wharf station on the Talyllyn Railway. They are bomb-ass ham sandwiches and no mistake. We pass a horse that looks quite like my Zelda horse. 🐎 I can smell somebody’s ham sandwich . Mr Bombastic again. @rjruss chap sat down after me, directly opposite. BAD. @rjruss the proper 2 person occupancy of a table seat is diametrically opposite, affording max leg and elbow room to both passengers. Someone’s ringtone is Shaggy Mr Bombastic. Grins on the table opposite as it echoes round the carriage. The sandwiches of the bloke opposite. https://t.co/Uh1vzQnH6y I am on the other train. Table seat with plugs. Bloke opposite is not diagonally opposite. Suboptimal. Lady opposite has some bloke’s name on her handbag. She’ll regret that if she loses it and it gets returned to that chap. We just passed two large white bulls. 🐂🐂 @jake74 chuck an email at me or Giles, there is also a bug report thread on yakyak forum, ta! @danielcassidy glad you enjoyed 50 😃 and congratulations on reaching the end! 🐂 @jake74 thanks for the report, we’ll be collecting up any issues for any possible future patch. @EmpJNorton I may have to top up on vindaloo near Heathrow tonight! I am smiling on the train 🐂 https://t.co/efjgdpfnUM @_WickerMan73_ very glad you’re enjoying the game, thanks! 🐂 I am going to a place near Kalamata in Greece. Giles tells me the olives are famous.

Every bit helps! :D A request - if you enjoy Polybius it'd mean a lot to us if you go to PSN or Metacritic or wherever and give it a rating. Ta! 🐂 @oldmario We'll see how the game goes as to whether it'll be worthwhile to do that, but yes, we are considering looking into that. @Nswitchplayer yes, we have EU or US, and EU does for the moment include UK :) @Nswitchplayer Best in VR but works fine outside too. Supports 3DTV as well. @SteelyDanM Hell yes I am! Still allowed on Euro flights I hope! I will of course be checking in if there's any signal there but I don't know if there will  be, place we're going is a bit off track :) Giles will still be here manning the fort and should be able to handle any Polybus-related stuff while I am gone if I do end up off grid. BTW from tomorrow I shall potentially be off-grid for a week, in Greece with my brothers. Not sure if I'll have internet there. Any reviewers still lacking Polybius codes, email me yak at llamasoft dot co dot uk, and specify EU or US region. 🐂 Polybius: early days.

https://t.co/fQhgJKWMy4 Polybius is making *us* smile now, due to the enthusiasm we've seen people having for the game! https://t.co/HRPIxWvmea Morning sheep time 🐑 https://t.co/E0ITyI5ugn @My_nameishuman yes of course :) @brandonorselli enjoy :) @brandonorselli you US or EU? @brandonorselli email me yak at llamasoft dot co dot uk and I'll hook you up :) *puts on Daft Punk Tron soundtrack* 😃🐂 https://t.co/bP1831xXbP but in that game it took a fair bit more effort to get there. This seems to offer a more acceptable route in to that kind of space. Enjoying seeing that people are pushing to new and nice headspaces with Polybius.

PSVR for transcendence ;) @sambeaujones actually SiS-as-a-tube has been on my mind for a few years now :). One day! OX APPROVED 🐂 https://t.co/arOcSJ3vrr Forgive me if I'm overpimping. Launch day relief at people not hating our game, just being super chuffed that people are having such fun :)🐂 RT @HeadcaseGames: Get #Polybius by @llamasoft_ox for PSVR. It's gorgeous, mind warping and extremely fun. Very inspirational as well! Works in 2D and supports your probably under-utilised 3D TV as well as PSVR. 🐂 https://t.co/ayffnRJmov PSVR is already physically most comfortable.

*makes the sign of the Last Human Family* @ascully Yes - obviously it's more immersive in VR but it is perfectly playable on a normal telly (or a 3D telly if you have one) RT @leeh64: I really don't know what to say. @llamasoft_ox Polybius on PS4VR is freaking incredible.U just get so consumed by it 😁😁😁 great… @SlowMvngTarget We've released 5 of them for free on Android. I'll likely port them somewhere more durable one of these days. cheers, makes me happy to think of Polybius lighting up retinas across the world 😎🐂 https://t.co/bpzwPqGo35 Glad you're  enjoying it! 🐂😀🐂 https://t.co/jrjgceecwK @Tobys_Tweets level 5, the Spectrum level?

Possibly.
🐂 @sijones hehe I'd bet there are a bunch of Euro ST and Amiga people who absolutely do remember Llamatron :D In town I thought I'd celebrate the launch of Polybius by having a small strawberry and cream tart. Managed to get cream up my nose. 👃🐂🐂 😀🐂🐂🐂🐂🐂 https://t.co/TXngQlMoS4 @tecknobehinde Yes, I absolutely intend to do just that. It's been quite a journey. Thanks!

Working as intended then :D https://t.co/tGuCCALg1S I'll get up a blog post with more about the development and design of Polybius in the next few days. @dndn1011 cheers man, it's been a journey :).

BTW I think we've earned a visit to Amsterdam. You up for a beer or so when we do? @OxC0FFEE It's best in VR, but perfectly fine outside of it too. Camera is only necessary for the VR version. So seeing people actually enjoying the work is a massive relief :).

Thanks all :). When you work so close to something you get to the point all you see is its shortcomings. Release time always anxious time. RT @AaronKThorne: @llamasoft_ox oh my god, my eyes are ejaculating some psychedelic jism! Totally amazing #Polybius is what #psvr needed 😭 POLYBIUS OST is now available!

I get the point. things I would like in the expansion:

- Steal indefinite horses
- Big bulls, moose and stags/deer fully cuddleable and rideable. Still a little disappointed I can't just steal indefinite horses. Jerry got an extra biscuit just now because he did a big baa when he saw me. Spotty Ears got one for doing biscuit face at me. 🐑🍪 My ideal horse would be the big bull. 🐂 Shame he can't be mounted and tamed. stasising monsters off their horses will never stop being funny. @IMcMillan my mum used to call it the "studio couch" when I was a nipper. ...and then have a horse beauty parade somewhere. 🐴🐴🐴🐴🦄 also it's a pity you can't get more than one of your horses out at a time.

Must learn to fight them proper :D Lynels now, they're jolly nice looking but actually rather bastardly. Far more deserving of a sword enema. I've got sheep like that. 🐑 I do feel rather sad killing Hinoxen because all the basically want to do is nap unless you disturb them. I can hear a robot opining that the humanoid should not destroy it from in the cab room.

My own cab swearing is quite pedestrian in comparison, consisting of nothing but the occasional cry of "tits!" when things don't go my way. "pipistrelle de merda" is a new on on me I must admit. Just realised I could monetize my cab by installing a swear box. I'm sure Q*Bert didn't originally include the word "stronzo". The swearing buzzer just went off. Giles is yelling about the dynamite. I can hear the bat. Now he's playing a8 Spelunker and the swearing floodgates have opened. Giles getting his manic on https://t.co/feRSEBFrsk I put Ultimate's finest Spectrum game on my cab. actually most rich person tat is proof of money impairing cognitive functions.

Immediately scored over 100,000 in Vic Omega Race. Proper cab controls a bit better than the old Competition Pro :D Was having trouble with all the split cart formats on the VIC emulator from command line so thought "fuck it" and hoyed the Megacart on.

"Shoot him in the arse!" Watching Giles in a battle near the end of Uncharted 4. I feel like I should lend him some of my Bomb Arrows. @skipai actually the Switch version of BOTW did sell more units than actual Switch consoles.

I kept mine in the leg pocket of my cargo pants, rather oddly making it look like I was connecting to my own trousers for power. that little thing adds Zelding hours well beyond what you'd usually squeeze out of the Switch. I must say for train travelling Switch users you really ought to get one of these and a USB-C lead. https://t.co/zOHfPg1gBN I am on the Carmarthen train. It’ll likely soon be shrine time. I  killed a monster and stole his horse. There is a man with a banana on platform 4. Coincidentally there's a funfair here just as there was on that day. https://t.co/chNqUbqNG2 I am in the exact place where I first ever played Defender. Somewhere a presentient emits meaningless syllable strings like some vocal lorem ipsum. Fingers like British sausages caress the chocolate-square keys of a laptop. There is occasional gentle gruntling. Lady opposite stirs and undulates slightly. Perhaps she is about to construct a chrysalis. Train spotters glisten in the unexpected Spring sunshine, anoraks venting. Why do apple even allow uncommanded app switch attempts? Some sites completely unusable due to shitty ads that do that. Abundant spawn roam the interstices. The institutions that program them must be closed due to ancient myth. Lady opposite is fully invested in the Apple ecosystem. And pies, by the look of it. Roused from a peaceful doze by double chin protruding lip bloke profaning my sacred tablespace.

Not really up on match-falling-things games apart from Tetris of course. DESTROY THE CHICKEN 🐓 I can hear the threats of robots coming from the cab room. @zerojay maybe I'm not thinking of teh same game? The MD game had kind of blobby jelly bean things and you matched colours. I can hear hadoukens coming from the cab room. Intrigued to see a new Tetris, but puzzled as to why they merge it with an obscure and forgettable blob matching Megadrive game. anyone out there using the ArcadeVGA card that can tell me the trick to getting Galaxian et al to display correctly on it? ooh this looks pretty :) https://t.co/cRDyflr860 Jerry wanted all the cuddles so I sat under a tree in the sun and gave them to him. 🐑🌞💕 @abbobast yeah I got it because I just needed *anything* to be able to take the Switch out.

Good straightforward golf game. @cmdrpaulfoster they seem solid enough so far Neo Geo golfing https://t.co/2qoSSHxHIH Soon I shall go to Gerudo Town to learn how to enter a Divine Camel, something I’ve been keen to know since I was a schoolboy. At least I now have a fuckload of Mighty Bananas. Had time muffle a few f-bombs during a stealth section lest I appear a mad old git to the rest of the train. Had to sneak past the guards without showing them my ticket and then beat the boss. I have the Thunder Helm and am in Bristol Parkway. I am at the station.

That *can't* be right, surely? 🐂🐂🐂 is there not a simple "use the screenshots from the MAME folder I already have" option in this thing?

I don't WANT some video clip. Hypewrspin now actually working on my cab. Just need to figure out how to make it less noisy and fugly. ok I got it to the point where it says "missing rom extension in ini" when i try to launch anything. Progress! Browse For Folder (Not Responding) why is it installing some things it feels like you have to fight every step of the way... Hyperspin instructions clear as mud. Find a tutorial and get as far as discovering my "complete" install d/l does not contain hyperspin.exe. ...and Chrome refuses to let me open the Hyperspin download because it insists it's a virus.

*sigh* ok, let's try Hyperspin instead then. Downloading now. I'd've actually liked to test to see if it works in my cab *before* parting with any money. NEXT! Looks like it's impossible to test launchbox's "big box" mode (needed to use in cab) without buying "Premium". Hmph. Morning sheep time 🐑 https://t.co/D7l6Pss8rY MAME cabbers: what's the best frontend these days? @elfasileopard I was passing a guy the other day and he told me "My donkey is getting wet!" @chiltonr nah it's just that Gerudo Town is like the Greenham peace camp apparently so I'm told I guess I'm going to have to dress up as a lady soon. 🐂 Skinnydipping at the oasis near the divine camel #BreathoftheWild #NintendoSwitch https://t.co/OfYLHY1eLZ Being unfaithful to my horse #BreathoftheWild #NintendoSwitch https://t.co/4VeKR7Xljx @AnotherWheatley Yep Jerry possesses the only horn in the flock right now! @FunkyM_FM217 Pretty much Giles' work.

Played a game where I'm a buffalo dressed in human clothes being carried by an unfeasibly large bird. You can also use your giant tongue on a pig, who cries blood out of his eyes as he dies. Played a game where you have to destroy all food to keep from getting fat. Played a game where I'm a naked man pursuing screaming ladies whilst being pursued by a policeman and a lioness. Morning sheep time 🐑 https://t.co/cZGuEfwIeg bed time, I have been zelding for way too long :) also look how pretty my horse is now, she has all flowers in her mane and even some on her tail &lt;3 who'd've thought Nintendo would be the ones to give me a game where I'm tasked with entering 4 divine beasts, one of them a camel. 🐫 End of session horse smooch #BreathoftheWild #NintendoSwitch https://t.co/euuHLA5j1O Train game down the pub https://t.co/tFCPhgVnAS End of session horse smoochies behind the stables. #BreathoftheWild #NintendoSwitch https://t.co/wk11CLZWgG I bet you are, I know your type. #BreathoftheWild #NintendoSwitch https://t.co/Cw1PMZ6sPv Must be weird having an entire fish for a head. #BreathoftheWild #NintendoSwitch https://t.co/uXt4yYiYx4 Afternoon sheep time 🐑 https://t.co/kJ5Gouz9zK Morning sheep time 🐑 https://t.co/iJKzovcTf9 I am on the bus.

Or a door *into* a sheep? Apparently Jesus once claimed to be "the door of the sheep". Probably after some particularly peculiar mushrooms one would imagine. 🐑 1: Having just finished my mortgage I have no intention of being in debt again.

I don't think I'll ever need to use the dog now. 🐂 me &amp; my horsie #BreathoftheWild #NintendoSwitch https://t.co/TwrJxd7NUn i'll always think this when i see that parrot #BreathoftheWild #NintendoSwitch https://t.co/iTXvjx2s0M (I was fairly entertained too, must be said, watching her trying to extract said biscuit with just hooves and a big nose). But a tatty £10 Matalan coat some years old with a Digestive biscuit in the pocket and she's entertained for hours. I bought her an expensive pink icosahedron you put treats in years ago and she can't be arsed with that at all. TIL it is hard to nap in the bottom field when a donkey believes you have a biscuit in your coat pocket. Just had to hard reset my switch. Met that bird in BOTW that all the furries go on about. Kept expecting him to tell me "I like to drink my own urine" in a S. African accent. First Summer-pattern Sunday afternoon: barbie, beer and a good nap in the bottom field. 🐂 @NineLeavez we've tried planting edibles. All the bunnies were very grateful. @orinoxide half the time I link a pic these days Twitter barfs with "suspicious activity reported".I suspect just part of general worsening. Rhododendrons are nice looking but I think they want to take over the Universe. 🐂 @countstex lovely horns!

Now it's evening oxercise time. 🐂 Of course the moment I have to test the more difficult YOLO achievements I start playing like an abject cunt. 🐂 I'm sure I would get on with whoever wrote these things. 🐂

https://t.co/RzrJ1VoAcW @bully_thelsb OX-cellent :) @bully_thelsb I hope there is a sheepie there somewhere! @cmdrpaulfoster People OX-pect me to put them in, I couldn't COW-ntenance leaving them out, that would be terriBULL. Testing cheevo unlocking and slightly worsening the bull puns in their descriptions. 🐂 It goes hard against the grain to have an achievement called TAUROCTONY but there it is. Morning sheep time 🐑 https://t.co/zRUdne3Xfy Bringing our MAME cab back to life 🐂 https://t.co/CrxhlVoLkL Well it's bloody awful out. Stables full of wool. Glad our lot at least have the option to be indoors when it's like this. 🐑 Here I thought Spring was coming but it's horridly cold and drizzly out. I shall do my evening oxercise to warm up after sheep feeding. 🐂 Added a line to make bouncing cows grunt. 🐂 @bully_thelsb indeed, and worth it for ad-free telly and no rubbish bollocks like that on the beeb news site IMO. @bully_thelsb I'm glad that doesn't happen on my BBC, that's just rude! Morning sheep time 🐑 https://t.co/TRTrCrgcYU still at least the sheep of hateno village are safe thanks to me. 🐑 @emperorwebrunnr that was the first thing I tried, still an immense pain in the arse trying to direct the damn ball onto the little platform Now I love my Zelda but by god those tilty-controller-rolly-ball-maze puzzles are bullshit of the highest order. 🐂 I was in the curry house https://t.co/JNI6qPco6j @championchap that's Herdy :) Too damp even for the tallneck https://t.co/qJBceewKMW Scanning for biscuits https://t.co/H4EKSmr2sL Nom nom 🐑 https://t.co/rsZP30ihHm Hay hay 🐑 https://t.co/r7AO8yjLxw This morning's weather https://t.co/SGgWflTtBy oh this is fantastic :D 🐂 https://t.co/ePNbeBEQu1 @dndn1011 sheep are actually more intelligent than given credit for.

Accommodation booked for next month's London trip. I wonder how it always ends up being in a pub. 🐂🍺🍻👍 Then discovering said restaurants menu is "lamb-focussed": Boo :( Discover quite famous Indian restaurant is round the corner from next month's London conference location: Hooray! There is a mad bird who is trying to get in my windows. Got quite used to playing with one ear in each hand, feels very comfortable.

...those things are its ears, right? 👂 i found the house of the chicken pervert #BreathoftheWild #NintendoSwitch https://t.co/UhNTSvJxMz i haz a hors #BreathoftheWild #NintendoSwitch https://t.co/rfVKaMfR4X nice horns are the best #BreathoftheWild #NintendoSwitch https://t.co/rdjO0oHFxu @JudgeDrokk @marksman1875 can't remember, it wasn't sold that much as it was soon supplanted by "proper" games :) @JudgeDrokk @marksman1875 also published as a typein for the same reason in I can't remember which magazine :) @JudgeDrokk @marksman1875 written the same evening I got my c64 working, published with the intent to show ppl how to do BASIC stuff.

Some of us solved this problem years ago but nobody gave a fuck.

Mobile really is an evil cesspit. https://t.co/xyw2ibNKI2 @Bob_at_BH that is one of the most evil things I have ever seen. @Markjohnb I'm in no rush at all. I'll leave the tutorial area tomorrow, spent a couple of days just wandering round here. Lovely &lt;3 almost nms colours in this sunrise #BreathoftheWild #NintendoSwitch https://t.co/lvfF00rDsi not evenleft the tutorial area yet #BreathoftheWild #NintendoSwitch https://t.co/QXWexKhJ5D ok this is a pretty game #BreathoftheWild #NintendoSwitch https://t.co/4G5ZRIHhQN We'd quite like to see the new Beauty &amp; the Beast but I am sad already because I know it has such a tragic ending. 🐂 Weather still relentlessly rubbish though. Stables accordingly full of wool. 🐑🐏🐑🐏🐑🐏🐑 I was in the curry house. Had a fantastic vindaloo that perfectly balanced taste and nuclear heat. https://t.co/YuCfAUsym4 @UzelessUK yes, and I have been intermittently Zelding since yesterday :) I am in the Bunch of Apes https://t.co/ZM9OQrVEdf Rubbish weather out. Sheep all indoors. I believe a nice warm curry is what's needed. 🐂 Sharpened the ends of my rockets to make them unequivocally even more non-phallic before preparing the PEGI build. 🐂 TIL there is a pig called the Geneconverter 900. It hastens to its death 3 weeks ahead of ordinary pigs, apparently. Morning sheep time 🐑 https://t.co/b7MB2Og1SX @RichStanton I definitely will! It's been refined a bit since what you saw in Nov, I'm pretty happy with how it's turned out :) @RichStanton Pretty soon now hopefully, we're lining up for an FQA slot in the next couple of weeks :) @oldmario yeah, but balance that with do I really want to take teeny cartridge things with me on a portable system. We'll see. @RichStanton Yeah I guess getting a pro is the obvious solution for on telly. Ouch my aching wallet :). Motion aiming is certainly easier with the joycons clamped, but I also like the freedom of just letting my hands lie where they want. Of course now I need to get some kind of switch case for taking it out the house. And an SD card since I intend to be download only. Not sure yet if I prefer using the dog or just separate hands for joycons when playing on telly yet. @mattmayatt I kept an eye on Argos and when one came into stock near locally I had that. London trip next month and I'm sure this will make for some pleasant train time.

Quite different from HZD, I'll enjoy both of them I'm sure Seems nicely playable on the small screen as well as on the telly. Frame rate isn't always perfect but it never gets too bad so far. I like the runes thing and the freeze time/impart stored kinetic energy thing is interesting, Tomorrow I'll do the last shrine of intro area Impressed with how quiet and nice it is just roaming around. No tunes playing all the time and that's just fine. Climbing mechanic is cool. Made myself an omelette with hot peppers in. Killed some goblin dudes. Made myself a potion. I like the cooking thing. Zelda seems really nice so far, just been wandering round the intro area picking up runes. Shot a boar in the arse. @Mechajabber Cawl is soup, usually made with lamb so I don't generally eat it. Other varieties exist though -cawl just means "soup" in Welsh We met a lady today who named her shop after goats because she used to feed grass to a large billy goat when she was a nipper.

A good lady. @Burthammer https://t.co/6Utr3KqeRy After a bit of faffing with the dock not appearing to work... https://t.co/VYwNcn9odP *BURPLE* I am as full as an ox. 🐂 Oh get in 😍 https://t.co/6iTORXVmBz Yum https://t.co/kxzC5fjCO2 One of Wales' hidden treasures https://t.co/qsnYWs71pA Sheep in a shop window https://t.co/XhfQBsK62v Right I'm off out to get a Switch.

Most games end with a tense boss fight. Mine ends by going "here, relax and score yourself a crapload of points" :D Tea is in me. I know there's an icosahedron at the entrance to the bottom field, I got one for the donkeys but they don't seem to like it much. @Jolt_Zekrom you can get 5 of them on android here (no donation necessary despite page name) https://t.co/zlu7pzJArw where are my dodecahedrons? ooh I'm sternutating Afternoon sheep time 🐑 https://t.co/wpvVZ3j55g @ancientscream they are sheared once a year usually around the beginning of June.

I suspect my homeworld is a bit bugged. #PS4share https://t.co/dF35w70E1B I'd only nipped by for a tad of candensium. 🐂 That was when the EXTREME STORM hit. I barely made it back to my ship and noped the hell out of there. Unfortunately he was charging at me while I was running desperately cavewards as my rad shield plummeted in seconds. At one point I caught a glimpse of quite a nice looking bull-like entity with nice horns. 🐂 I hope tonight's NMS planets are more welcoming than yesterday's radioactive hellhole. App Store "celebrating indie games"? I highly doubt that somehow. Crushing indie spirits, more like. I love the fact that Atari VCS games are used so often in AI research. 🐂

https://t.co/1srX9FWWf5 Level 45 is a little ode to Uncle Clive. @DoctorLabcoat Yeah the lack of any kind of resolute opposition in the face of abject idiocy is disappointing and baffling really. @DoctorLabcoat well I'd hardly expect them to be that great at maths really.... But hey, it's the will of the thick half of the British people who voted on the basis of a bunch of lies, so OF COURSE let's carry on! Goat knows how we got to the situation where half of Britain looks on powerless and exasperated while the gov't fuck us all up but good. @bully_thelsb it'd be harder to keep them away usually as they come running up as soon as they see us :D.

And I haven't found a pretty enough world yet to make me want to move base to. 🐂 ..but there is no mark on the map. So I can't complete. I think I'll have to move base to unstall it. The reason my base has a rubbish farm is my farming dude is kind of stalled. He says to go and get some fragments and marks my map..

I'm going to have to move base at some point (or buy a freighter) as one of my quests is stuck. But I need to find the right planet. But that framerate increase is like the warm sun coming out from behind a cloud on an early spring day. Warms the bones :).

Lovely :). 🐂 also that photo mode is deadly. I can put the sun anywhere? I'll be here for ages just doing that you bastards. 🐂 better textures, nicer colours, way nicer framerate (don't let anybody ever tell you framerate isn't important), *and* buggies?

Morning sheep time 🐑 https://t.co/bFykMrzMpB I can hear a donkey going off. 🐴 That Spectrum loading noise definitely works on the levels where it is appropriate :) 🐂 🐂💦👃🏻 there are the Thanking Ships of level 10 which thank you pretty cheerily for your shooting them I suppose.

Game's probably British enough. actually I think I may already have a couple in there that say "I beg your pardon". I suppose to be fully British I should make some enemies that apologise when you shoot them. 🇬🇧 Modified certain enemies to emit Spectrum loading noise upon demise. Red Dwarf Crash Zzap Radio 4 Shipping Forecast fish and chips drizzly weekends Hover Bovver Gordon Bennett Test Match Special British, me 🇬🇧 Not the horrid Tory Brexit jumped-up jingoistic unrealistic expectation stupid puffed-up nonsense peddled by the Brexiteers I hasten to add. The kind of Britishness I like is the cups of tea, beer, curry, Sinclair Spectrum, London Underground, biscuits and Monty Python kind. Maybe one day I should do a tube shooter that takes place on the actual Tube. 🇬🇧 Sometimes I worry that this game isn't going to be British enough. Made the Sinclair cubes tut if you shoot them and they are shielded. Afternoon sheep time 🐑 https://t.co/X4qLLYDq2C @C64Reloaded I am inserting the folded chocolate shaft into my moist upper ox-hole.

So you smoke 1 fag for each day of Lent. Right after much faffing my video is definitely clean.

(Well, apart from the fact that it's called ohfuck.mp4. I shall rename it.) Today is Ash Wednesday, which means all Christians have to have a fag. @KK_Nidhogg my favourite was Rude Llamatron. If a thing's worth doing it's worth doing properly. I have, however, left in the "Never eat lamb again" subliminal. 🐑 the subliminal "Buy Jeff a pint of beer" became "Buy Jeff a nice soft drink" because alcohol-mentioning. Making my PEGI-rating-video.

WHY U DO THIS? 🐂🐂🐂🐂🐂🐂🐂 Without Twitter working on the phone I won't be able to post my Sheep Time notifications either. That's if Periscope even works any more. @oldmario You can't receive SMS via wifi. Meanwhile Tweetdeck is still working somehow but if I go to tweet a picture I get a message saying there is no Twitter account. WTF. Eventually I get it. Re-authorise phone. Go to log in via settings and it just keeps on coming up with "username or password incorrect". Which is a pain in the tits as sometimes I literally have to go half a mile up the hill to get a mobile signal. Nothing Twitter worked at all. So I logged on via desktop and tried to reauthorise, which involves getting an SMS to the phone. ok Twitter has completely shat the bed on my phone.

Funky iMac with rubbish mouse and MS Surface instead. I see they've made up for omitting Sinclair and Commodore last week by shoving them in the "games consoles" list. https://t.co/ayUUlLwYX4 I can't imagine a significant interruption to that connected flow; in fact I think such an interruption is one of my greatest fears. my life has been measured not in decades but in terms of projects, one connecting near seamlessly to another back to Commodorean times. if I'm travelling, talking, preparing to talk about things, I'm not coding, not making.

if I'm not making what kind of an ox am I? 🐂🐂 also I don't get where people get *time* to go to all these conferences and talk things. If I'm not sat coding here nothing *works*. 🐂 @robert_watson Just my evening oxercise.

Anyway evening oxercise time! 🐂 I think the Reset Level Sequencer Pill is one of the meanest things I've ever put in a game. 🐂 Apparently Sony CRT tellies have something called an Automatic Kine Bias. So do I, in the ancient sense of the word "kine". Butterbean looking a lot more lively since his treatment too. 🐑 Poop has been shovelled. Things have been put into sheep.  Llama has been skritched. Time to go and throw poop over a fence. 🐴 @AmigaBeanbag well I do have an occasional glance at https://t.co/USM92Aehkg couple  of things in that list mind: goat/sheep confusion, and I'd really rather not see dead animals with human gun gits alongside TYVM. Most people's cup of tea clickbait is about celebrities or football.

We should totally have democracy sausages in Britain too. 🐂 one day I guess the distinctive CRT display look will only live on in the imaginations and works of shader artists. RIP kv-28ws2u :( My old CRT telly that Giles was grooming as a secondary MAME display has died. I am in the Lamb of Rhos. 🐑 https://t.co/56F9ogLqjJ @conkerhimself @Disney to me that story is a tragedy. Who would want to become a peltless human after having been the Beast? New toe straps installed and evening oxercise done.

Much better. 🐂 I hope they take that New York bull to an animal sanctuary, he deserves it after making his escape. 🐂 Due to a likely OCR character misinterpretation Basingstoke is sometimes misrecognised in scanned texts as "Baaingstoke". Which reminds me: only 4 months until Caprichoso time! https://t.co/01tmAd47Jp The variable that controls bull oscillation rate is called "boi", which is appropriate, as "boi" is Portuguese for "ox". 🐂 @bully_thelsb My own research has led me to believe that Digestive biscuits can be key to improving relations with hoofed quadrupeds. @avon_deer There's only one level where this bovine transformation is possibull. @anderszapac I've always wanted to do a wireframe tank-like shooter called CattleZone. Made the player become a bit harder to control when he turns into a bull. 🐂 It is the morning, and there is time for putting Digestive biscuits in sheep. Morning sheep time https://t.co/zO7UDNqOlr I am in the curry house https://t.co/jRwbtZ5lpp That rare thing a nice letter from the bank. 🐂 https://t.co/YnDBNoVdrY Things have been put in the sheep.

However, and most excellently, it plays the tune from The Lumberjack Song throughout. Morning sheep time https://t.co/7ec8Ryloth I can hear a donkey going off. 🐴 Tox on The Ox Box.

"Dio sporco!"
"Dio porco!"

https://t.co/qYbC3171xE I am in the curry house https://t.co/OFaPFj9JXU Morning sheep time https://t.co/S4eNTP4f0b No Sinclair or Commodore machines on this list? Smeg to that! 🐂 https://t.co/ZLdsKI62F1 @datsuncogs couldn't this time as we had to get back to our own :). Perhaps another time :) Back home, flock all feasting outside :) 🐑🐏🐑🐏🐑🐏🐑🐴🐴🐪 I am watching a tiny spider fiddling on the edge of a ticket. https://t.co/lPFPng6fBQ I am on the other train The once contested table seat finally lies empty and unclaimed. Nobody can be arsed for the short remaining journey to Swansea. Creaking and groaning and throat clearing as Spherical Glasses Dude prepares to alight at Neath. Having napped sufficiently I stow my public buffalo plushie and gaze out at lovely Port Talbot Parkway. Biscuits at Bridgend. I decide to further nap and prepare to snuggle up to my buffalo. Noises of ill-advised mastication come from Spherical Glasses Dude. Rouse briefly at Cardiff to see Spherical Glasses Dude gasp his way down the carriage to claim the recently vacated table seat. Perhaps I should take a nap. I have a public buffalo plushie in my pack which I can use as a pillow. 🐂 Safely under the Severn and back in Wales, glancing outside I see sheep after sheep. Reassuring. 🐑 Disappointed, she bimbles off to slump dejected further down the Quiet Carriage. Glasses Granny boards at lovely Bristol Parkway. She bumbles up the carriage until she sees Big Briefcase Balding Guy ensconced. Someone is tapping in a most un-Quiet-Carriage fashion. He’d better knock that off lest people start to tut. We pass a barn quite full of cows. It was glorious. Beats Headphones Fool is defeated and seething. He lurks at the far end of the Quiet Carriage, a beaten man. Faced with the prospect of having to share Beats Headphones Fool was forced to retrieve his coat of shame &amp; retreat down the Quiet Carriage However newly boarded Large Briefcase Balding Guy passed him in the aisle and plonked emphatically down in the disputed table seat! He dropped off his coat there to stake his claim then went to fetch his partner in villainy from further down the Quiet Carriage. Smug Laptop Bloke left and immediately Beats Headphones Fool comes scuttling up the carriage to nick the table seat! Giles covers Rainbow Dash with his coat. Smug Laptop Bloke talks on the phone. Sounds like he’s alighting at Swindon. Maybe we should nick his table. I am eating half a cookie. I can still see the socks. Giles is using his Rainbow Dash plushie as a pillow. https://t.co/4ry6ZA780A We pass a small army of diggers planting little trees observed by patient bovine eyes. 🐂 I can hear the rattling of Smug Laptop Bloke’s laptop keys. 

Git. At Reading, my incept place. The Quiet Carriage is quiet apart from occasional coughs, sniffs and grunts. Any farting is strictly SBD. Thankfully I cannot smell them. Glancing through the seat crack I can see somebody’s socks. I am therefore slumming it in an ordinary seat in the Quiet Carriage. Chiz. There was one in the previous carriage but it was directly adjacent to a lady with noise-emitting presentients and thus eminently unsuitable Despite our best efforts Smug Laptop Bloke was already at the table seat. Git. The other one was cordoned off for unknown reasons. I am in the Quiet Carriage.

He emerged euphoric 😀👌🐂 Polybius hit beta. Home stretch now 😀🐂🐂🐂 @fizzymouse it’s at Sony in London (square and triangle off to the side) 🐂 🐂 https://t.co/l3IpdQQwoT I am on the tube Girthy peculiar beard chap keeps putting stuff in, a tad unwisely by my estimation. Opposite a lady kisses a chap whose head is shaven but only from just above the ears downwards. His mouth is working oddly, like a disconnected Michael Gove. Fat bloke with an odd sort of beard gets on at Reading, displacing the ladies. Giles declares he would sooner kayak than row. The smell of the ladies wafts down the  carriage. The ladies are talking about painting the flat hard bits on the ends of fingers. The ladies pass round gum and fall to cudding. Giles stirs and admires some white LED displays outside. This is turning into the ladies’ end of the train. I quietly sing a song of love with my nether mouth. @ukieluke yes, Llamasoft is now based near Carmarthen. We have a company flock of sheep. My arse whispers sweet methane nothings to the train seat. We draw ever closer to the home of Crazy Frog. Just noticed my last tweet was geotagged Old Sodbury. How appropriate. I am roused from post-bacon nappage by a lady with leather gloves. She inspects one of my roundrects. Haircut after haircut joins the train. We arrive at beautiful Bristol Parkway. We pass a bunch of saesneg sheep. 🐑 I am external to Wales. This train has both a buffet and a trolley for some reason. Outside people are playing golf. In the rain. On a Tuesday. Bacon is entering the top of the ox  🐂 I can see a cardboard policeman. We pass several more cows. Well 1.8 million of us should go and tell him to piss off in person when he shows up then. Relocated to a table seat. We pass several cows. I am on the other train https://t.co/vR6yJbEn2a It’s a 4 hat situation now. Someone down the train is quoting from the Bible. A large Irish lady murmurs sweet nothings into a phone scarcely visible beneath a curtain of ginger hair. Moaning man actually stops complaining for a couple of minutes. Camel bag Mick Jagger face lady peruses a passel of Post Office pamphlets. Someone’s phone starts giving directions to somewhere which is rather odd as we’re on a train. Latest hatbearer has a tiny Hitler moustache. It looks a bit like he has the end of a paintbrush shoved up each nostril. @RoganJosh I never eat lamb. Hats++ Complaining man has phoned someone else and continues to air his considerable grievances. I idly wonder why the announcer thanks me after every station announcement. Apparently he’s now keen on doing further business with Damian. “He’s sending the crabs in Bristol ” “He’s got a scorpion on his pocket” He just mentioned breaking someone’s legs if further upset. Unidentifiable accent guy is moaning and moaning. Carriage hat count 2. Chap starts to complain on his phone in an accent I am entirely unable to identify. At Gowerton cricket ground the wicket waits moistly, patiently for summer. @buzz_clik I will one of these days! 🐂🐂🐂🐂🐂 @JimMcCauley sounding brill too! 😃 Chap opposite busts out a newspaper commensurate with his hairstyle. @JimMcCauley cheers dude 😀hopefully should go well 👌🐂 Somewhere down the carriage I can hear a small child initialising. The ladies alight at Llanelli having never paused their high bandwidth exchange for a smidgeon of an instant. We pass between the sea and a park in which bedraggled owners empty sodden pooches. One of the ladies has an elaborate handbag. Must be weird to care about handbags. Words tumble out of the ladies. The train picks up speed. Low cloud surrounds us making it look like the Nintendo 64 version of Wales out there. Morrisons eyes dude could scowl for Britain. Glancing out the window I can see a wet horse. In awe of the ladies’ chatting ability. I can just barely grunt at this time of day. Bloke down the end must never have to pay 5p in Morrisons judging by the bags under his eyes. Wales is shrouded in drizzle. I hope London will be a little less moist. Ladies still chatting. Train still rolling. I can see tiny little lambs and their mums outside 🐑 Ladies opposite could probably power the train through the power of chat alone I am on the train Sheep injection given. 🐑 I am in the curry house. Thinking of the KLF for some reason. https://t.co/RdWESd3fLI look at that blocky green ox. 🐂 https://t.co/CfgBzclszf @EvilKimau I'll leave copies there so have a go next time you'll be in :D Right, that's it, I'm done coding, no more bytes before our beta review at Sony tomorrow.

Ought to be a C64/Vic equivalent :) @Peteuplink I shall be allowing people to look at them if asked, and then throwing them away. I have bought some very expensive pieces of cardboard. Posting this again because you can never see enough happy sheep. 🐑🐏🐑🐏🐑

https://t.co/dBoYg1E5y5 @Peteuplink He's good, he was standing at the door baaing to go out earlier. We're continuing to wash the wound. having been bitten by a sheep at the next full moon I shall grow a fleece and eat an entire packet of Digestive biscuits. 🐑 I think the likeliest conclusion is that I was bitten by a sheep in this morning's somewhat hectic scrum for Digestives.

Probably Jerry.🐑 I have cut my finger.

I have no idea how I cut my finger. 🐂 Morning sheep time https://t.co/GiM4Ez1xEW @giantkeeling I once ordered something described as a cocktail Phoenix and when it arrived it was Space Firebird. Did you know: the familiar opening melody in Phoenix comes from an electronic doorbell melody chip? Giles has one somewhere. Played a bit of Omega Race, because Omega Race is awesome. (Vic 20 conversion was godly, too). @robert_watson the Vic 20 was full of rubbish, some of it of my own making. Some goodies though, also some of which I like to think I made! I did quite like Vanguard too though. I still recall fondly the first time one yelled RAINBOW ZONE at me in a chip shop in Basingstoke. and no not Vanguard, IIRC that had 4 buttons to shoot in the ordinal directions but you couldn't fire diagonally. here it is https://t.co/9kn4TxhmbL shame it sounds like someone constantly trying and failing to start a car throughout. @LouisGorenfeld no not Vanguard. It's called "Mars" by Artic (most of their games were rubbish but this one is pretty good). Played a 1981 game that's an unlikely mashup of Scramble and a twin-stick shooter. It's surprisingly good fun actually. 🐂 @Diamond__Lights It had some MAME audio system error messages where I think any speech ought to have gone. Played a piss poor clone of Astro Blaster. Wondered why anyone would bother making a piss poor clone of Astro Blaster. Played Bosconian. I still think the guy yelling ALERT ALERT sounds like a New York cabbie. 🐂 Initial design and evolution of Marble Madness. Documents from within Atari coinop. https://t.co/UfDTFP7tcM 🐂 played a game where I'm an old man crapping on blue cats. (It exists. It's called "Uncle Poo". When it starts it says "LET'S UNCLE POO"). @SlyCat every shop and garage has all the varieties at the counter so it's an ever present temptation. Dark choccy ones are my fave :) @SlyCat those are made just down the road from us here :) I put on my ox-shaped slippers. 🐂🐂 Abscess washed again and injections given. I always hate doing that :/ Making certain ships thank you sarcastically when shot. Playing a Logg/Theurer game I'd never even heard of before. @hewey999 I think that's more of a beginner-piece than a masterpiece :). I'm going to have to stick needles in him later. Neither he nor I shall enjoy that. Here's Butterbean with a repurposed sock to lightly cover his wound. 🐑 https://t.co/KrXNBivvI3 Sheep knee abscess washed. 🐑 @Dr_Memory You may be thinking of this https://t.co/epB5x67B0P Morning sheep time https://t.co/yRkoZavpSS I have deleted the standing order that went to repay my mortgage. 🐂 (the game seems pretty solid and I'm already plenty smiling throughout, so that should hopefully be a pleasant task) 🐂 Hopefully we'll hit beta this week then it's a month of debugging and for me polishing every level till they all make me grin like a bastard But it absolutely isn't here. You can play this all day and never feel a bit nauseous. in Polybius we've tried to reconcile opposites like "absolutely fucking insane speed" with "VR", which normally is a ticket to the toilet. I do love to hear the gargling of the best score annunciator out of the corner of my ear as I blast through the erupting coruscation. 🐂 @tonalaxis thank you sir for making it sound so fucking awesome 😀🐂 Sheep fed and abscess re-washed. 🐑 Polybius contributors check your inboxes. We will be starting a stream shortly. Sheep knee abscess has been washed. 🐑 Hasn't crashed or gone peculiar too so 👍🏻 ok, the oxen of defeat are grunting in the tube of oblivion. 9.6 million, got to level 12 in YOLO, I'll live with that. 🐂 YOLO mode is cool for when you want a shortish game. I can't imagine anyone actually getting to the end in this mode. 🐂 tch, I have to recompile everything. I think I'm allowed a quick go of YOLO mode ere bed.

Considering recording a sample of me yelling YOLO! for occasional use in this mode.🐂 @Peteuplink Should go beta next week, I'll be looking to hit FQA about a month after that. OK, phone ran out of battery. Hope you enjoyed that little look at our complete and fully operational Polybius :D 🐂 It is the 2010s and there is time for https://t.co/nLJ1JxjYzZ @JamieM4rtin We haven't given up hope of being able to release TxK for ps4/psvr... Giles just died on Nonsense in BASIC. 🐂 I am in the curry house https://t.co/7sqDgczvBO Morning sheep time https://t.co/nVSnPYPHpi Right I'm off to bed before I gas myself where I sit. NN all :). I must say Giles' famous fart soup has been on point tonight. Dear God. 👃🏻🚫☣️😱 @rhodri looks like a messy Thursday night dude :) Testing trophies. I got several bovine-related ones.

Unsurprisingly. 🐂 Right, time for evening oxercise. 🐂 Level 39. "Brexit Miasma". Level 31 is called "the real fight starts now". 🐂 I really ought to finish naming all the levels. And I might have to rename that one with all the dildoes. 🐂 Right, I think I have made it impossible to pause bits of game that shouldn't be allowed to be paused. @bully_thelsb I am a British ox and thus compatible with tea for daytime operation and beer at night. Hot liquid is being poured into the top of the ox. 🐂 flatic stoat flaffle; I wonder if anyone will recognise it :D I'm going to steal a sound sample directly from one of my favourite (and most criminally underrated) Amiga games ever. Just pulled two big bits of hay out of my hair. 🐂 Morning sheep time https://t.co/eNYoDLbQiA https://t.co/Iyk8aykNrY

#brexitbull 🐂 "I'll just play till the next music change".

"Oh, tune, I'll just enjoy this for a while"

...

"I'll just play till the next music change" oof. Game's made me hold my piss for near 30 levels rather than hit pause and purge. Didn't want to break the flow for, er, flow.

Good. 🐂 Then we played dominoes. #YOLO 🐂 @FracturesAudio Bit blocky. Games night again https://t.co/i89jjFigAq Right. Time to remove my shepherding trousers and don my going down the pub trousers. 🐂 Testing correct function of level select screens. Oh the joy of finishing up all the little bits at the end of making a game. 🐂 Eating a mini bag of Twiglets. 🐂 #YOLO I am sorely tempted to eat a mini bag of Twiglets. 🐂 @bully_thelsb don't feel bad, not like our lot are doing much better these days what with all the Brexit nonsense and crap. Right, time for evening oxercise. 🐂 @Peteuplink well there already is Sheep Time, which is far more interesting than me sitting at a keyboard occasionally swearing. Added a small smelly-ox-related bit of literary analysis to one of the Game Complete screens in Polybius. 🐂 During Sheep Time we discuss important matters like: who is fluffiest, who has the loveliest ears, who needs their cuddles and fuss. 🐑🐴🐪 (there was a bit of Trump in this afternoon's Sheep Time, as at one point Maya lets off quite a loud one). When Twitter's too full of Trump and Brexit and you just need to chill out there is lovely relaxing Sheep Time. https://t.co/9eCbYNjdKo Afternoon sheep time https://t.co/ZJE80tmuOs I am an ox full of soup. 🐂

(no, not oxtail). @Willeth Our coverage is pretty good, only small corners of the middle and bottom fields aren't covered, and a bit by the stables. I am buying one of those power bank thingies for situations such as this (and handy for train trips and such too). Apologies for no Sheep Time, (a) sheep were out of wifi range today and (b) upon invoking 3G 20% phone charge disappeared in 10 seconds. Either somebody's moving a wardrobe outside or a donkey's just gone off. 🐴 @shahidkamal @remasterfm Hardware quite capable and fun.

Ecosystem awful, developer-hostile poison. Avoid. and did I mention that the tunage is fucking sublime?

So lovely seeing this all come together now :) 🐂✔️🇰🇵 But so rushy you'll just grin and go "oh, you cunt" and take some more :D and that's not to mention level 34. 

So easy but so also a complete and utter cunt. &lt;3 it's not that it's intrinsically hard, just that you've been through 30 levels and you know how things work and suddenly it's "by the way.." Holy cow level 31 is a harsh mistress 😱 Clicked a thumbnail of cute Herdwick sheep and it opened up into a picture of Nicola Sturgeon doing the pointy finger. Right let's see if some portion of today can not annoy the tits off me. 🐂🐂🐂 TFW people come onto Twitter to moan about being on Twitter. Recurses. Coding must pause while we go to town to obtain sheep fuel. 🐑🐏🐑🐏🐑🐏🐑 Game will occasionally encourage player with a cheery "BEST SCORE AT THIS JUNCTURE, WELL DONE!" message. 🐂 Video streaming from Polybius confirmed working. 🐂 Morning sheep time part 2 https://t.co/CtqAop7TZk Morning sheep time https://t.co/r3bKaQlNYv I can hear a donkey going off. We have plenty of tea. I am in the curry house https://t.co/7AdS2JFZv5 I have a boolean flag in my game variables that signals "break and exit". @Peteuplink 128 logical colours, could all be onscreen through per-scanline changes to playfield and player/missile colour registers. Morning sheep time https://t.co/xd5ghm3Pc2 @NineLeavez that is why I never even look at the App Store for games. I'll play games on a system that isn't a bitter, twisted wasteland. The thing is "avoid falling blobs while farty noise plays" probably sold for 20 bucks. Games were really just once "avoid falling blobs while farty noise plays". https://t.co/Qywa1XyA5U @orinoxide ahah they sell those in my local highland cow themed service station.

Pebble was best IMO but fuck Fitbit :(. Mention the thing you're selling occasionally, OK. Mention it every fucking day and it's unfollow time.

Use a commercial account for that. Maybe I should make that #YOLO just to be perfect. 🐂 in the hardest mode instead of dishing out extra shields it just puts up YOLO in large, glowing letters. 🐂 #define ACH_REVENGE_OF_THE_MUTANT_BOVINES 20 // They'll get you in the end.

🐂 @bully_thelsb You have already earned Achievement #15, BOVINITY, which is awarded for successfully entering Bull Mode. Wiring up the cheevoes. Shan't  make you have to fully complete in YOLO mode, that'd be excessively mean. 🐂 Making sure there's not a shortage of bull puns in the text messages. 🐂 Morning sheep time https://t.co/zYgCg05c8L People who ask why the aliens are attacking with cows in Polybius obviously don't remember the lessons of the Mutant Camel Wars. 🐪🚀👽 @NineLeavez "Spelling bee" is another WTF one. Apparently in olden benighted days they even used to have "lynching bees". whenever I see the American phrase "baby shower" I can't help but think there's urine involved. ♉️ ooh I'm sternutating *gruntle* 🐂 I have replaced some of the mooing with grunting. Much better. 🐂 Morning sheep time https://t.co/8liV0GWIKB OK even I might have to concede that there could be too much mooing in some of these levels. I was testing and wondered why the tunnel I was in suddenly seemed to smell bad.

Giles had passed by and dropped a sly fart :/. @GreyAlien I never eat lamb. I have not eaten lamb for more than 30 years now. I am in the curry house https://t.co/ShPcDkeu6X I may be fossicking about with save data updating but my mind is wandering towards the curry house. Sound bank building. Holy cow we've got so much amazing music in this game. 🐂 Inserting a disc into the top of a llama https://t.co/gyP0xhrsBP Stable full of wool 🐏🐑🐏🐑🐏🐑🐏 https://t.co/2LQy8HZVgq Madam indoors too https://t.co/p1LvsTpz2j New hay for breakfast https://t.co/yhZ71QzBNR All the sheep are indoors 🐏 https://t.co/PbIBU3gPZR I have done my evening oxercise. 🐂 Flying down the level hearing the towers muttering, praying for fried eggs and trying not to annoy the cows. 🐂 I have made the small towers mutter rather than just do a normal explosion sound when you shoot them.

Sounds weirder and better. Pronghorns have a distinct, musky odour. Can confirm the stables are full of wool. 🐑 I say, it's jolly rainy out. I hope the sheep are indoors cwtched up. 🐴🐑🐏🐑🐏🐑🐏🐑🐴🐪 @JudgeDrokk @ZinG_UK @zawtowers @ZZAPRRAP @JazRignall @gyratory @Boogie2988 @futurewas8bit @TheOliverTwins I have no "Interceptor Software". char *advice_silly[] I love that moment where it just goes PING! and all the mooing starts. 🐂 @Peteuplink Polybius supports PSVR, non-VR and 3D TV. An amusing bug I introduced had the space invader aliens falling over sideways and turning into little glowing number 9s. Just tested non-VR mode by playing it on a 2D virtual screen in VR and I feel peculiar now. Morning sheep time https://t.co/fbiNwJbZpI Board games night in the pub https://t.co/lV6z3jhGjx I have seen the new Trainspotting, and it is good.

Only disappointment is that despite a few teases it never fully broke into Born Slippy. @skipai Whereas I am all for knobgobbling in general I do feel the line must be drawn when it's Trump's knob. Ew. What a complete and utter knobgobbler. https://t.co/a9f1cxQruG In two weeks' time I shall be in that London. 🐂

(where's the tube roundel emoji? eh?) I am on the bus. I am in the pictures Today there will be a brief hiatus in coding while the car goes in for new boots and while that's doing I'll be seeing T2. Sorry for abrupt end of Sheep Time. Phone swore it had half a charge. 🐂 Morning sheep time https://t.co/iP8FiFsBT1 @GigerPunk Indeed. Especially as your eyes are busy having millions of colours rammed into them at 120Hz.

Sounds are important. They add a lot to things I'd grown to take for granted. A nice whoosh for a lift gate, a bassy thrum for the deflector kicking in. 🐂 As I go back over everything finalising stuff I'm adding occasional sound effects I never quite got round to earlier. @SheepyTina "same great taste" is always a terrible lie SYS64738 "probably the most vibrant and",
"exciting town in all Europe.", "When visiting Europe be sure to",
"make time to visit Basingstoke,", (sadly I don't think a few of my helpful hints will make it into FQA somehow ;). "simply drop a few F-bombs and you",
"will start feeling - and playing - better.", "Swearing can be therapeutic and helpful.",
"If you find the game is frustrating you,", If you rest in the transition sequence, the game will entertain you with a series of hints. Morning sheep time https://t.co/I6tBviix8O I can hear a donkey going off. 🐴 got to love this Londonist review of my favourite London boozer @peltonarms :)

https://t.co/6ujT4uiydD It's been a bit of a journey but it's lovely to see it all coming together now as a proper complete thing.

Just a bit more grunting, ox. 🐂 A free tweak to my default explosion routine has yielded effects that make it even more like the 5th of November in my headset.

🐂 Whatever else is going on I guarantee that every night (apart from a couple in London) between now and release will be spent on this.. Well time for a bit of happy hat time ere bed.At least in there orange bastards can be swiftly dealt with and yield satisfying bonus points. never thought I'd be retweeting a GWB quote but there is is. https://t.co/RhjFr3R6r2 🐂🐂🐂🐂🐂🐂🐂🐂🐂🐂🐂🐂🐂🐂🐂🐂🐂🐂🐂🐂🐂🐂 or *they've* picked fucking Trump I mean, I had no part of any of it.

They are wearing hats with "FART" on. They are worshipping their President Fart. I can't imagine going into a public space wearing a Make Britain Great Again hat without being some kind of massive nationalistic weirdo. so much burberry. Do they still really believe in burberry over there? Weird. Still looking at the inauguration gigapixel

People wearing burberry unironically

iPhone cases with a bit cut out so you can see the apple. Ah my favourite bit of Deadpool. https://t.co/NQDgNZawJe So fluffy 🐑💕 https://t.co/RzQIfbzdiY Nom 🐑 https://t.co/BbRS8T74Xm Good morning madam. https://t.co/NP4FcmaCHX The sheep on Sheep Hill. 🐏 https://t.co/KcSIux4Czn Look at that face 🐑 https://t.co/eTpE9l9RIr Morning sheep time https://t.co/p8NS8GW2L6 Unfortunate dude caught at the very instant he was about to plunge his finger into his left nostril.

I'll stop now or be here all night :). Funky vicar spotted. I wonder if that lady intended to dress up as a cow. 🐂 I just found a lady with three hands, one of which is blowing her nose. why is there a dude there wearing a Chelsea FC hat? It's like a Mandelbrot set of mortified humanity. Poor Obama looks like he just smelt a particularly eggy fart. This is awesome. 🐂 Some of the expressions are priceless.

https://t.co/wX5dXAQV6V @muskieratboi ahah wrong kind of beefcake :D I am in the curry house https://t.co/QiYRDNVZNa Here, have a video of a large bull pleasuring himself. 🐂
https://t.co/3ncDURp64i @Peteuplink Yeah he gets a stiff knee sometimes. We have drugs we can give him if it gets too bad, although usually it sorts itself out. Morning sheep time https://t.co/DIC9SLrqAs @ireland_rob blame S. Munnery, I wouldn't've been doing aught to inspire anybody of his Asteroids hadn't been so dreadful ;). @muskieratboi go for it! It's a good game to tackle as a learning experience, as it's simple but has a few nice subtleties :) Played a game where I'm a mouse and the same two squarewave chords iterate endlessly, searing into my brain, destroying my sanity. @muskieratboi Bonus points if you get the enemies stepping individually rather than as a block too.

A lot of implementations were lazy. @muskieratboi global variables holding left and right extents and marching speed and direction that every entity can see, perhaps? Played a game called Minotaur's Treasure.

The Minotaur's Treasure wasn't what I'd been hoping it was. The game generates a maze, entire-cup-of-tea-boiling-kettle-brewing-drinking-and-everything slowly.

There isn't a minotaur in it. Played a game called "Minotaur". This was on the title screen.
https://t.co/SEkUYVrIZd (also chalk another one up for the &lt;entity&gt;&lt;mental illness&gt; naming trend from the early 80s). Played a game called "Meter Mania". For some reason. In the actual game you are a disembodied bear head pursued in a maze by space hoppers. Played a game where potatoes silently fall onto my chess piece. Playing a game which declares itself to be "copywrite" on the title screen. @justinday82 it was a character-mode Scramblish thing done by Romik for the Vic 20. Played a game where I'm a bleeping screwdriver dropping fish on churches while somebody pokes random pitch values into a sound chip. Another reason I love my Apollo heroes so much. They were basically put through the Total Perspective Vortex. https://t.co/PHfqB2TCnG @BenCrosland given the amount of postprocessor distortion that goes on sometimes i think mere colour is inadequate to indicate what I intend And now it is time for a little investigation as to the best colouring of enemy shots in player shielded and unshielded modes.

🐂 @KrllGojira that is a sheep that requires a Digestive biscuit. Somebody randomly blessed me in the biscuit aisle of Carmarthen co-op the other day. @noop_dev yeah I find the Speccy-based clones and homebrews of the era quite interesting! @DoctorLabcoat https://t.co/16BUrWBom3 STEP DIM

In truth we were good mates :) @TheWoodvine I should hope not, I sent them back before xmas. perhaps I should wear it on my next train journey. It might stimulate some interesting train tweets. *grunt* 🐂 https://t.co/b7btv4ysCq @avon_deer it's just a mask really but rather a nice one, Giles got it for me from Spain and I got it this morning :) Back to work 🐂 https://t.co/PwMjx8ARYI My feels after watching Giles complete TLG: https://t.co/9bnGVrxtLR @36VWI I hope so too, TxK surprised me totally with just how lovely it came out in VR. I'd love to finally be able to release it. @36VWI if we can ever get the roadblocks to go away the actual game is pretty nearly complete already on PSVR. @happyhero Not going to say much about it so as not to spoil. Hit me right in the feels (as the game did a few other times on the way). @Bob_at_BH figuring out decent controls was the first thing I did on iOS. Boiled my piss that hardly anyone else seemed to bother. I actually recorded some of his epic swearing on my phone, which will make for decent blackmail material should I need it. 🐂 After a truly Herculean swearing effort Giles has finished TLG. I am in the curry house https://t.co/GCk6yGYAB9 Giles enjoys the large dinosaur plushie I got him as a belated Xmas gift. https://t.co/hB53zMfyU1 I wish I was as good as Jesus there when it comes to flock management :( Jesus said, 'I give my sheep eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.' This 1972 minicomputer is labelled in Atari VCS font 5 years before there was an Atari VCS.  

https://t.co/0tz075gdUO This is how code was written in Britain before "Uncle" Clive and his ZX80 blessed and redeemed us all. https://t.co/Xg00O1S05D In IBM and business in general there seems to be an expectation that your "big jobs" will inevitably grow over time.

Glad this is not true. They are talking about an optional loader configuration that could save you an entire 1.1k which I expect you had to pay nasally for. Reading an antediluvian IBM brochure about "processing big jobs". "Holy cow, boss! This baby can use any of its registers as a stack pointer!" Quite possibly the nerdiest comic book ever. https://t.co/dW6ye5c6pF @JimMcCauley dude we have to come down and drink whisky with you some time this year :) my cached Grauniad homepage has various images of fireworks going off rotating and one of Trump doing the pointy finger mixed in. @retroremakes HNY to you too dude. May your bus trips be as lovely as those of my youth twixt Tadley and Basingstoke Bus Station on the 337. HNY all. Let 2017 be the year I finish both this bloody game and my bloody mortgage. Amen. 🐂 @PVBuk cheers man, HNY to you too *hugs* :) I am disappointed the autocorrect thing didn't state that my 2017 would be in the curry house. My 2017 will be a London and the iPad to be a good time. I've almost been in tears a few times watching Giles play TLG. The creature AI is just astonishing. @RobLawfordUK We still have one left. @datsuncogs he was 25, which is like 100 in llama years. Trying to remove a dead llama from a muddy field using ropes, battens and a knackered old Seat Leon is like some kind of macabre videogame:/ And for that we can only be thankful really :). Thanks for the kind words all. Nature is nature after all and endings are inevitable. Iki had a long life and a swift passing. Sad news I'm afraid, Iki's gone :(

He was a very old boy (vet was quite astonished at his age) but still, it's never nice when it happens. I'll miss glancing at my wrist and grunting in the mornings. 🐂 maybe one of these days I should just leave the Apple ecosystem for good bit I don't need a new phone for the foreseeable, so... I'd never buy anything as masturbatory as the Apple watch but I do use an iphone so even if there was a good Android one I'd be fucked. I hope I can still use the crap default watchface and actually useful alarms if I can ever get it off the "connect to pebble app" screen :/ Until then it's bye bye news updates and cricket wicket buzzes. Maybe one day someone will come out with another smartwatch that doesn't suck and I'll get that. OK I have updated, rebooted and reinstalled every fucking thing and my pebble just will not pair. I give up. @DeeJayDragon if you like them, subscribe. Just don't want it rammed down your throat by everyone all the time. Fnarr. Rebooting, reinstalling and repairing my Pebble app and watch. I hope this'll fix my no watchface updating bug. in fact if you ever see the word "subscribe" on a YT video just substitute "suck my cock" and react accordingly. Likewise any channel that starts with &lt;name of channel&gt; jerking around to dubstep, which must be a lame default preset somewhere. @RobALiquorStore Bonus negative points if they post the word "subscribe" in vibrating text. in 2017 I resolve never to subscribe to any Youtube source that mentions the word "subscribe". @captpackrat ours can be a bugger to get hold of at times too but at least here in Wales there's the excuse of rubbish cellphone coverage. Maybe it'll be nicer when dawn comes up. I'll check tomorrow. Nothing looking that promising on the scanner though. anyway I wanted to end tonight on some lovely garden planet but Sarn Park's a hellhole full of arsehole beasts. @captpackrat farriers operate entirely in areas outside of mobile phone coverage. It's the only explanation. Creatures like this make me glad I'm digitally anosmic. #PS4share https://t.co/49YN4EzvOf @VisionaryLight She's a Herdwick, their coats start out dark and turn silver as they get older :) Fluffy! 🐏 https://t.co/7Z1BHf1drt Herdy is a pretty little sheep 🐏 https://t.co/Bbby96pMGw My sheep follow me; they demand of me Digestive biscuits. https://t.co/aU0jZB53Nb Morning sheep time https://t.co/cAOZ6KKG0n My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me. Just watched The Acid House. Giles had trouble with all the Scottishness. I seem to be unable to set any watchfaces on my Pebble. Surely the servers aren't dead already? want to know what it sounds like when Giles has a bad code day?

😂🐂 Lovely stars tonight, stood outside  for a while looking up at the Milky Way.

There was the sound of distant mooing. 🐂 Sheep time https://t.co/wHgfnm9CMl @ManuelStanislao lovely horns :) I am eating a multitude of cheesy snacks. @arganoid Appropriately enough :D @arganoid https://t.co/nBP38YuTEr :D One day I would enjoy having a "Be careful, It's My Buttocks" horse doormat. https://t.co/anwmwSp1Qk Morning sheep time https://t.co/OdbrZ5GMqS I like it when Trico waggles his ears. @Jim_Philpot Yes, significantly concave so the orange is the same size but contains less chocolate. I hate these sly cheats they so. I am eating a bit of posh ginger cake. I have also had 4 segments of dark chocolate orange. Giles looks like he's trying to climb into Trico's arse #PS4share https://t.co/G9nwnZsQw4 Nadolig llawen i bawb! 🐂 @plasticdemo what you've made is truly lovely :). A real joy to play, thanks :) The exception to that being NMS of course, scarcely a day gone by without my hour of chill on there.

GOTY for me :) @xiotex we have Occy, will give it a bash on there :) @xiotex thank you sir! I shall enjoy having a look at that :D So nice to have a bit of time to play other peoples' games, as developers you tend to not have enough of that! did I mention I like the monster in Bound?

He has ears a bit like a Herdwick :) ❤️ Move controllers (that we got from CEX for cheap months ago, lucky us) on charge now for a bit of drunken fruit Ninjaing later :D 🐂🐂 Played a bit of Bound VR earlier. Lovely artstyle and still sharp visually even in VR. Very much enjoying that. Home from the pub and about to crack a tin of festive lager. 🐂 Playing Bound in VR.

I have to admit I really actually rather like the monster. 🐂 I have been being a third-person dancing lady thing in VR. @RobLawfordUK I had some flying rams with little fairy wings once :) @ThatThereTim Yep, been grinding at it to get the giraffe plushie suit :D FINALLY I AM A STINKY GIRAFFE PLUSHIE #PS4share https://t.co/CRFinDt7E8 Morning sheep time https://t.co/a3IDLvKMuw Here's a device that plays back music from an SD card.

Feels really natural when you are just in there and playing :) Arcade time in the barn. Giles on the telly with the Shield occasionally yelling FANCULO. Me with a visor on occasionally yelling TITS. @Paul_S_Moran you too!

I've enjoyed telling the story of my NMS travels. One day I will find my New Ultrabasingstoke and build a base there I am in the curry house https://t.co/yWv7xUDkdS @IMcMillan I found some beautiful Scientology poetry! L. Ron Hubbard was such a genius!

https://t.co/kOH7H2YVzo

(my head hurts now) "When a high tone fights entheta, he comes in very later."

"If you would overrate, just let it make you rate."

Moved to my very soul I am. Ron says "If you can decipher these, you'll know everything there is to know."

"The upset of tradition is the way to eat roast pigeon." I believe L. Ron Hubbard was truly not human.

He was obviously a Vogon. Behold LRH's magnificent poetry:

https://t.co/kOH7H2YVzo Today I am signing various things and sending them off in envelopes. 🐂 My right jeans leg is muddy from having been poked by a sheep with his hoof. Morning sheep time https://t.co/xuxIWZc3ut @GigerPunk @Psybernoid first time I saw that film was in a cinema in Amsterdam, nuff said :D @GigerPunk @Psybernoid It's not like they don't tell you how to say it multiple times in the soundtrack too :D @Psybernoid @GigerPunk they just need to reproduce the plumes of spliff smoke in the projector room now :D @GigerPunk @Psybernoid so last night I was all https://t.co/GrmvGOysCc

YEAAHHH :D @GigerPunk @Psybernoid back in the day I had one of those old 3 lens projectors and we used to watch Koyaanisqatsi on it @Psybernoid @GigerPunk haha mix tapes and posters are exactly the next things I'm going to be doing :D @Psybernoid @GigerPunk Yeah me too, lots of fuckery needed to get it Just Right, but worth it when you do and walk though your arcade :) @Psybernoid Oh it's great, you forget you're in VR, you're just playing pinball. "Presence" right there :). @Psybernoid @GigerPunk Oh yeah niggles aside it's fantastic, been loving setting up my arcade. This and Zaccaria pinball great VR stuff :) @Psybernoid Yeah games with state in nvram work fine but full MAME state save needs working, would help with startup times too. @Psybernoid ah ok I'll have to look into getting the right bits then.

Now if only they could get state saving working that'd be boss. Then his mates showed up mob handed and I was just fuck that noise. #PS4share https://t.co/47LGULuReU All I said was that he had nice horns and he just fucking went for me. #PS4share https://t.co/cE7Nf16otn Oh this is excellent :). 🐂🐂 https://t.co/8LSGoKSDk9 @DavidWimbush Impressive that the whole game was made by one dude who was just a couple of years older than me :). @DavidWimbush first time I saw Xevious was ducking into a dim arcade on a hot day while on hols with mates in Argeles in the south of France wanna see what's in my arcade? https://t.co/bLeOKJtFUf @Jim_Philpot ah these are virtual VHS tapes for my VR arcade I'm talking about. I'm not sure I even have a VCR in the real world :D Plus sort out music for the arcade and a bunch of videos for the VHS tapes and cinema room.

And make some posters. Of course I still need to put in all the SNES carts and get ahold of some Game Boy roms for the Game Boys. Albeit more aggressive Xevious than the original, jfc black orbs and snow all over the shop! 🐂 I had to cheat slightly because Xevious was crashing NRA:N. So I'm running Namco Classics rom on that machine, it has Xevious in. @dndn1011 Do not turn off your computer.

https://t.co/laE2QAxWfR one thing I wasn't expecting from the new Blade Runner was Harrison Ford's tits.

https://t.co/zR9M2biGQu Now i just need to find where to tell it I have a 5x7 matrix of attract videos instead of a 5x6 one.. I wonder if I can get a big picture of Eugene's head in there as a poster to gaze a benifice over the Jarvis cluster... Changing all the FPS machines in NRE:N to a little cluster of Jarvis games. A little Jarvis shrine in the corner of the arcade. The toilet was also a car for some reason. Last night i dreamt I was delivering the most expensive toilet ever made to somebody and had to be really careful with it. @shahidkamal Penblwydd hapus Shahid! Behold my garage full of hay 🐑🐂 https://t.co/Mywog1zPgN Morning sheep time https://t.co/6rtbQxlXpd @Stressed_Local Nope, just stocking up on stuff to put in sheep. Haystrike incoming. Enjoying setting up that arcade in VR. If I ever survive to my drooling dotage I could see me jacked in to such a place semipermanently. Nowt much here but more of that striated xenogeology. #PS4share https://t.co/hrpuTgvKqZ Farewell, potato. #PS4share https://t.co/djbRVuQu2p Commodore 64s. Bitz bars. Pyramints. Cans of Quatro. Need to be able to import more objects and furniture too. Big packets of Rizlas for example. I'll have to dig out some music for it, bit of Rush, Genesis, Floyd, that kind of thing. Put Koyaanisqatsi in the cinema. I did have Wizard of Wor saving its state at one point, but only using a different MAME core, and it didn't seem to work with the others. Still, attract mode videos working now, and vertical games no longer stretched. Getting there.

Must put some Llamasoft posters in there. Setting up New Retro Arcade continues. Bit of a faff getting everything right. Wish I could get machine state saving working. @RobLawfordUK There will certainly be Sheep Time at some point in the day as long as I remember to charge my phone the night before :) We're getting hay for Christmas. @PrototypeCube it is impossible to read the article without hearing it in your head in Philomena's dulcet tones. Every parsnip contains about 12 blowoffs, ranging from a big one at the fat end, to a little squeaker at the point.https://t.co/CfpwX6KyHq Morning sheep time https://t.co/I3UZL7ifwx as opposed to just dipping into a giant list and never giving games as long as they deserve.

Plus the immersion is very cool :) As an emulator frontend I like it because by putting fav games in a virtual arcade you concentrate on those... @C64Tone If you don't mind having to do a bit of emulator setup fuckery to get things set up how you like them, sure. It's a cool toy. I'd love to open a Llamasoft arcade with my fav games and films in and have mates over to visit :) I hope one day it becomes possible to build a virtual cinema/arcade and invite people over to fully share all the games and films. I was excited to hear it had multiplayer capability but in truth it's fairly limited, you can't play the games with any visitors really. I also set up a few machines in New Retro Arcade. It's really just the fanciest emu frontend ever but I really like it. So today I used cutting edge VR hardware and a boss ass GPU to play SNES F-Zero on a virtual 1980s telly. After a torrid time on Hubbard's Elbow it's nice to chill somewhere not a smeghole. #PS4share https://t.co/Qhy744kWfQ Morning sheep time https://t.co/jtURkPmfuY I could probably have had the giraffe by now but I spent up on the flappy camo to go with my deer head because it looks more like fur. 🐂 @Jim_Philpot I completely agree, never buy that kind as a matter of principle :) @mattgrayc64 Mate of mine's was  a  train driver. Free train travel all over Europe too. I need to grind out another 8000 points or so to get my stinky giraffe costume in Steep.

I could IAP it but I wouldn't dream of doing that🐂 My trousers are becoming increasingly disreputable. 🐂 remember the little girl who did the  Welsh numbers station at the start of Space Giraffe?

She just passed her driving test. 🐂 Only if you hear someone's in games jdon't give them "Oh you must be rolling in it". They're probably near skint and working their balls off Anyway don't get me wrong, at Llamasoft we've been lucky enough to still be going after near 35 years, and I do love making games. Morning sheep time https://t.co/WWOda3N3Jo @limey_tank then there's F2E curry, first one's free but it's laced with addictive chemicals. Chef says "fuck ethics I need money"... "And most people think they should have curry for free".

Now why aren't you a millionaire? "Also you cannot sell a curry for more than a tenth of the price it was in 1982". "Anyone in the world can open a curry house, even using just packet curry from Aldi". "Now imagine every other curry house in the world is on your street."

"And they all deliver. Anywhere." "You spent years learning how to make curry and opened a curry house". I tried to explain to the guys at the curry house how making games doesn't make you rich. if only there were some way I could walk around my NMS planets whilst wearing the smelly giraffe suit out of Steep I'd be videogame complete Chill bedtime ship shot. #PS4share https://t.co/TbM9xosTsJ It's like a game of snooker in here. #PS4share https://t.co/hbTMZ4Om6B Terrain definitely becoming more peculiar. #PS4share https://t.co/6ySzkyRBB9 Nice caves. #PS4share https://t.co/VUs2BqB2AO @JimMcCauley I got the Gold version but in play doesn't seem IAPy even without that. Kind of fun when you get a feel for it :) Giles crashed just in front of the finish line and actually passed through it for 0 points. @MrDanMor yes :D Giles is yelling DIO SPORCO. Giles is getting through the last gate before the finish line and smashing into a tree. Giles is punching the sofa and yelling FANCULO. Giles is swearing and swearing. Giles is yelling at a wingsuit. Giles is snowboarding into trees. So I set it as MY main ps4 and suddenly that allowed Giles to play all the games. For some reason. Clear as mud :D turned out it hadn't set the Pro as MY main ps4 even though I thought it did that when I transferred all the games over. Transferring to the PS4 Pro seems to have had the side effect of not allowing Giles to play anything at all if he's logged in. Although I shall not rest content until I don that stinky giraffe plushie suit. I enjoy the fact that it has a "make stupid deer noises" button. Deer deer #PS4share https://t.co/G7otRwJWo0 First and most important gear acquisition. #PS4share https://t.co/1AAkGb5MS7 Santa Horse 🐴 https://t.co/NURERGZGRB anyway today I must get some sheep food and some human food, and I intend at least to get the deer head in Steep. 🐂 Morning sheep time https://t.co/d46xUcu8Yn Ate a bit of non-Brexit Toblerone. @GigerPunk if I could get far enough away from "pay your bills" to tip over into "peace of mind" then I would indeed be a happier ox. If you don't mind so much about the money though, you do get to spend all day making cool shit, yeah. But don't come expecting riches is all If money is what you want then absolutely, definitely, do not look for a career making games. Just don't. All my brothers have normal jobs and basically just constantly go on holiday all the time. I'm the pauper of the family. I've stopped telling people what I do for work because often the response is "Oh you must be a millionaire then".

They have no idea. I've had no real holidays since 2011. No appreciable disposable income for a decade. My car now is older than the one I had 10 years ago. Got an email asking if I want to participate in the "Software Development Salary Survey".

Just about pissed myself laughing. so if I get the giraffe in Steep does everybody online see me wearing it?

Customers at Newport https://t.co/9zPDGceOts A Chinese chap with a most peculiar haircut eats crisps and swigs Coke Classic (apparently it’s called that again) I am on the other train. Considerably less ram packed than the last one. 🐏 A lady stands in the aisle, pudgy fingers flapping over an iPhone 6 Plus. I can see right up her nose. A man walks by outside with a finger firmly inserted into his left earhole. I  briefly make eye contact and the digit is withdrawn. Trying to remember the last time I wore a hat. The train should be thankful I haven’t dropped one. The train is very crowded and I had egg last night. A lady laughs like slicing cucumber. Two more hats and a headscarf get on at Neath. There are three hats in this carriage. The trolly lady sings her trolly song. I  burp unexpectedly loudly. Somewhere someone tweets “burping guy over there smells of cattle ”.  🐂 Burry Port would be better named if they incremented the first letter. The train stops outside Nebula Tattoo. Through the seat crack I can see the distended earlobe of great age. A lady talks about her wool eating Siamese cat. I can empathise having once lived with a Siamese cat wool fetishist.

I  can see the smokers outside Paddington station from here. Still at least it's nice to be able to have a Viveless fiddle until the real Oculus version comes out.

I love how clunky and real they feel :) @EalaDubh And it's early access anyway so I expect the UI to improve over time. @EalaDubh On the PC in VR the UI is a bit of a dog's breakfast but the tables are really lovely. @EalaDubh Oh they were terrible at first on iOS. Rather good now though, lovely model rendering details and the physics is not bad. anyway blame the Zaccaria guys for no 8-bit Atari blog this weekend.

I was busy. Playing pinball. 🐂 Now if Farsight would just do the same for Pinball Arcade that would be lovely and I'd end up buying all the tables over again. 🐂 But in VR each machine feels so real somehow, you soon recognise which will be favourites.

It's absolutely lovely :). 🐂 The character of each machine comes over so well too. I've played the same tables on iOS and bar a quick go just left them alone. Finally an end to scrolling. It just feels so great to be able to just look around the table naturally as you play. Who'd've thought simple pinball would be so great in VR?

Really rather surprised and delighted by that, to be honest. 🐂 Had a couple of good balls on Robot so I think I'll stop.

Must. Stop. Playing. Pinball. :D That VR pinball is so good it's kept me out of my spaceship all day. @shahidkamal Scrabble with Elaine from down the pub and the occasional game of pinball is all I do on iOS these days. Playing in VR is just so superior in every way to playing on an ipad. 🐂 Well I have to say that Zaccaria pinball is just excellent in VR. Bought all the tables even though I have them all already on iOS. Installing an FTP game. (It's Zaccaria pinball and the kind of FTP where you have a demo then buy tables you want is just fine).

"This article appears to contain a large number of buzzwords."

🐂 🐂*gruntle*🐂 @photonstorm My co.uk I suppose, but bugger that, I've had that domain for nearly 20 years. I occasionally get buzzword-bingo-laden emails from people soliciting business from them and sent to me in error. Looks ghastly. They aren't  even anything to do with games, just some boring business crap from what I have seen. I was basically ignored and they went ahead and used the name of my company anyway. So any conflicts now are their own fault. 🐂 I replied pointing out that I had warned them when I first heard of them years ago that they might want to call themselves something else. Whether I would be "open to releasing the current domain so that we can use it."

I think not. 🐂 Just had an email from some American company calling themselves "LLamasoft" about my domain name. Listening to David Miscavige talking about L.

Used to be Wednesday. and while I am moaning, it gets dark too early and the ambient temperature outside is too low. It's taking me a while to get used to putting out the bins on a Tuesday night.

https://t.co/aPquHBWSM2 LIVE on #Periscope: Morning sheep time https://t.co/A7jPuXSwxc I shall try not to spill curry down it tonight. It's pretty much exactly the same as my last llama jumper but less smelly and with no holes apart from the usual jumper topology ones. I have a new llama jumper. Or a pub where you can drink pints of fine ale for free as long as you take a shot of cold sick with each one. Crappy ads in a beautiful game's like a posh restaurant where you can dine free as long as you eat a little bit of dog shit between courses. @oldtimergamer Yeah I have no probs with trial/upgrade, that's more than fair. Designing in microtransactions is evil though. I'm even put off playing the otherwise excellent Zaccaria pinball on iOS now because it asks me if I want to "watch a video" for extra ball. Make something beautiful, abd charge a decent amount for it FFS. Own the value of your own creation. Making it FTP is just pissing on it. How on earth do you even think it's acceptable to create something lovely but spoil it with shite ads? Apparently it's quite beautiful to look at but encourages you to watch shitty ads for shitty mobile games to gain extra stuff. Reading the reviews of Molyneux' new game, I just don't get why he is so wedded to the whole free to fucking play thing.

Spending $95 on a pair of socks is stupid.

Spending two grand on trousers is stupid. also is it just me or does that guy look like a complete knob. Rich person trousers cost $2000. Either (a) somehow they are magically worth $2000 or (b) rich people are stupid.

https://t.co/6LENfjPJYz I made an antipowerup that resets the level sequencer. Now it's time for my evening oxercise. Making a bad pill. @blakespot in British English trump just means fart. So we see you guys as having President-Elect Fart who lives in Fart Tower. anyway time to put hay in the sheep. 🐑 Added a scoring mode that allows the use of fried eggs and invaders' shots to generate large clouds of twinking, floating 500 pointses. I am drinking some tea and having a bit of cake. 🐂 ooh I'm trumping and trumping.

GOOD. More devs should do that and step away from hateful F2P. Take  back some fucking value. 🐂 I eat a bit of pre-Brexit Toblerone. LIVE on #Periscope: Morning sheep time https://t.co/FIJ5CmmYhU ok nice review of the MiniNES in the Grauniad but the historical waffling completely ignores the actual origin of mainstream console gaming. Hm. I would say that "the birth of the console as a mass, mainstream entertainment product" was down to the Atari VCS myself. @blakespot just want to be able to visit my favourite planets with my PSVR now. Was just in a cave with vortex cubes lying around packed as densely as the Toblerone of a proper EU country. @gatchers erm https://t.co/afi0eulzCo @bobpielock It is the beach at Llangrannog.

LIVE on #Periscope: Morning sheep time https://t.co/ESbIlaN8i8 So I hope it went to some enthusiast who would treat it right rather than to a skip. Please god, amen. 🐂 New people seemed to neither know nor give a particular smeg as to its fate. We did tell the last people it was somewhat precious though... went back there today and the place seemed to have been done up and under new ownership and no sign of that ancient original Spacies. we found an ancient tabletop Space Invaders, with the original Japanese play instructions and everything, and it still worked. actually down at the seaside today was a bit of a tragedy, we went to a place we'd last been to a couple of years ago and in a pub there... @robert_watson I actually bloke the space bar on my 800 through Smart Bombing with my foot so I had to get better without them :D Yes I can definitely feel some a8 blog rambling coming on in upcoming weekends, I'd enjoy that. Defender wasn't a bad port either, if a bit too forgiving once you got good (I could play forever without using any Smart Bombs BITD). Deluxe Invaders from Roklan was a lot better. Likewise 1981 title "Galactic Chase" wiped the floor with Atari's official Galaxian port. Asteroids was rather lacklustre (although 4 player coop was kind of fun) and what on Earth they thought they were up to with Space Invaders? Atari's (arcade port) cart output varied drastically from the excellent (Missile Command, Donkey Kong) to the rather poor... And as the a8 was very much a minority machine in the UK there's quite a lot of stuff that's not as revered as it ought to be. one day I should do a series of blog entries about my favourites on the a8 because there was some great stuff on there. @RogueColonel yeah good game but tough as old boots, scrolled along at a very fast pace making cavern manoeuvring quite tricky! @PVBuk https://t.co/TLhUd3BzBa now I am going to have a go of The Tail of Beta Lyrae just so I can enjoy the tune. &lt;3 so that's a 1MHz 6502 system running the code for coin-op Asteroids (also 6502) while simulating vector gfx and audio. Madness. also blowing my mind on the a8 is Asteroids Emulator. Which somehow emulates an Asteroids coin-op fast enough to be playable. I got up to around Level 5.4 and boy those killer satellite sections are complete bastards. Also missed my E several times. *it'd've When in the hands of a master, of course. Utter shame that game was never released BITD, it's've blown my tiny mind :D It's lovely to see how a relatively slow system like the a8 can yet deliver an intense, sensory-overloading 3D shooting game like Blaster. Haven't worshipped in the Church of Jarvis for a while so just had a lovely satisfying go on Atari 800 Blaster. Delicious. 🐂 The edge of Wales https://t.co/pCQrdCYpyW Good afternoon Spotty Nose https://t.co/Jlnv3i6Wun Now now ladies https://t.co/FIt2LFiAY1 Good afternoon cows 🐂 https://t.co/FdbNsmhbvo I am beside the silvery sea https://t.co/4IsVtkegSg so now there are TWO Intellivision versions of Hover Bovver and a 7800 one I've never even heard of?

You can thank Giles later ;). I can hear a donkey going off. 🐴 @shahidkamal Just pointing out that it's possible ;).

(With copious amounts of Italian swearing that is) :D @PVBuk @PlayStationEU @Mizuguchitter Basically just that Polybius has that extra VR resolution even on a non-Pro ps4. At 120Hz native too. @PlayStationEU @PVBuk @Mizuguchitter Rez Infinite pushes to 2x oversampling in VR on PS Pro.

LIVE on #Periscope: Morning sheep time https://t.co/sTnXsy4Zze It's coming. https://t.co/hzXLOFK2H9 @FrancisLillie :D I am glad my silly game could have inspired anyone else to start making their own :D @skipai specifically games that relied on NTSC artifacting to generate colour and which subsequently looked like complete smeg on a PAL set. Played one of many games carefully designed to give headaches to anyone not using an NTSC display. that explains to an extent the background done in kind of isometric using pixels the same aspect ratio and size as Mars Bars. ahah that last one I mentioned was actually the first game put out by System 3. 😄 Played a game where no more than three 8-pixel-wide things attack a player thing to the sound of someone ripping up bus tickets. Played a game that looks like it was done in one of those compiled BASIC efforts that let people make games without learning properly how. Played a game where no matter what I do, I die and it signals that event  by beeping the keyboard speaker. Played a game that looks like it was lazily ported from an Apple ][ with little regard for the superior capabilities of the Atari. Played a game where everything turns into bits of chicken. @billkendrick a8 at the moment. Played a game where the programmer never attempts to overcome the sprite limitations despite the machine being eminently suited to doing so. Unfortunately "Bible Baseball" fails to load. I'd've liked to've seen how they worked those two themes together into a coherent whole. Played Battlezone 5200. What a complete load of old smeg that is, especially compared to how good the 2600 version managed to be. These games would go out for fifteen or twenty bucks apiece too a lot of the time. Unbelievable really for the pile of old cobblers you got. Pity that the gameplay on top of the backdrop was pretty much "what if Space Invaders had only one Invader" level stuff. BETA FIGHTER had impressive-looking screenshots in its ads back in the day and indeed upon playing they are not bad if rather blocky. SPACE ACE which I remember seeing quite poshly advertised in Compute! back in the day turned out to be supremely boring and ugly. Then you play and a tiny ship shoots space hoppers forever (but never more than 3 at once) while a noise like a car alarm going off plays. I love it when old games totally hype themselves up then are completely smeg. "SURVIVE - IT'S THE NAME OF THE GAME!" trumpets one. Played a game where values changed on a memory mapped display while a sound chip emitted squarewave tones of various frequencies. @BitVictim the son of the Democratic nominee for Governor of Vermont, as far as I can make out. hahah this is the nutter who had a go at me https://t.co/R9zMNyG7X6

I notice a large statue of an ox next to a restaurant as the train leaves the station. 🐂 I am on the train @RichStanton @JimMcCauley a lovely end to a busy day, was great to hang out and that curry was a belter 😄 I am on the platform. There are some girthy buttocks indeed on the platform at Filton Abbey Wood. Lady opposite now full of egg. “Great stuff, great stuff” says the ticket bloke to every successful check all down the train. I glance enviously at the big bits of egg. She also has a water bottle labelled “Pretty Water ”. Lady opposite gets out a large egg sarny. 

Mmmmm egg. Tempted by the trolley but did not yield. He follows it up with the rapid insertion of a substantial bag of crisps. Portly chap opposite commences an unwise and passionate tryst with a large bit of cake. Lady opposite correctly occupies the other side of the table seat and commences to fill a complicated looking vape. I am on an intermediate train. Train cancelled at Cardiff and there’s no Lion Bars in the shop @CthuluFett I’m sure there are some in the larger towns. A man slumps slumbering over his table.

Like a drug. @korruptor @Jonathan_Blow pity we didn't hook up this time, I'd've liked to throw you in there ;) @Jonathan_Blow thought you might like that ;) @Jonathan_Blow Well there will eventually be a Vive version of this.

https://t.co/RouIBgnZFL @Dopamine_Gamers I must admit I'd've been tempted had I a large fart brewing at that time. LIVE on #Periscope: Giles playing Rez VR in his pants https://t.co/mQ681db0NE why on earth do I now get emails from loads of people wanting steam codes to review a 7 year old game? The prize was getting to spend New Years Eve on a cross-channel ferry. It was perfect. I was playing one night near Christmas a couple of years ago and I heard Tony Blackburn announcing a competition on some local radio. I think I might have a little ETS2 sesh. It's been ages, and if ever there's a winter sunday afternoon game it's ETS2. Or do make me make it, if you want :). never mind Eve and Elite, where is my VR Star Raiders? Come on Atari.

Don't make me make it ;). @shahidkamal never forget they also produced Star Raiders. And Eugene Jarvis, may God bless his sainted soul. Basically if you have a PSVR and don't know what to buy, just buy Rez and Thumper straight away and thank me later. @tripcodeuser "Somewhere in Detroit, a dwarf is passing out". @tripcodeuser how did you know the intro text to level 9 of Polybius? Are you an FBI spy? I am sure in 20 years' time they will look back on our stupid moon goggle boxes as horribly quaint and ugly, but for now they'll do :) (And a stupid-looking box of lights strapped to my face, but I don't care about that) :D Just seeing all that stuff all around me as I play has had me sitting here with a massive grin on my face throughout :D. It's lovely how Rez was an early 00s view into a kind of Gibsonian cyberspace, and now here in 2016 you can actually go in there :D We love Thumper too, been enjoying that and Rez alternating. No surprise there's a lot of love for the abstract stuff here :). I remember saying ages ago back in DK1 times that if someone wasn't porting Rez then they damn well ought to be. Glad they did :) Holy hell the last level of Rez in VR 😃😍😀 @forgotten_grove they just need a nice cuddle. FEAR IS THE MIND KILLA 🐂👁👁👂🏻👅 Harry Krishnas were in town today, not seen them around for ages. @Tomleecee yeah I've liked Rez since forever Unlocked the level X of Rez. Very much "oh hey wow GPU particles are awesome" :D Played a game where I'm a beetle running down a Hotwheels track snapping pencils whilst under the influence of a hallucinogen. @JimMcCauley nah, I have that downloaded for later on, just off out in town in a minute. Rez VR also proves that with a properly set up PSVR and good software there is absolutely nothing wrong with the tracking. Wheee Rez in VR is as nice as you'd expect. Not recommended if you have a stiff neck mind, it has you rubbernecking like a tourist. 🐂 LIVE on #Periscope: Morning sheep time https://t.co/CnUNZ9BfDQ @MatttLloyd TxK VR has been finished for over a year now. I still hope one day to be able to release it somehow. I remember demoing that on a DK1 in Blackpool, we had massive queues even for just that, VR was so new. maybe after I finish Polybius I should tart up and release my old Minotaur Rescue game I originally did for an early Morpheus prototype. mind you I should have my VR legs by now, been dicking about with it since 2013. also I *didn't* get sick in Driveclub demo. right that's Rez and Thumper on to download. 🐂 Porn. https://t.co/gADsb6XndF @Japan_Game_Love Yup. https://t.co/RouIBgnZFL I am in the curry house https://t.co/QXNggZK5Lf OK.

8-bit Atari Colourspace is nicer mind. @gatchers I guess Microsfot thought your average BASIC-using numpty wouldn't be able to cope with proper hex. @JudgeDrokk because you are telling the 6510 to execute code at $0005 and unless you poked something meaningful in there first it'll crash Regarding Brexit, I wish we could just SYS64738.

https://t.co/nYlAVkwTGF @marty11285 @ReplayEvents We are indeed. @corbin_connie it is lovely seeing them finally gain the confidence to join the rest of the flock there :) The enormous ears were everywhere. #PS4share https://t.co/AHzmkETRX6 This creature smelt wonderful. #PS4share https://t.co/GXq6kA3Rlz The onion bhajis on this planet were out of this world. #PS4share https://t.co/8PL3ppVleI Apparently there is a creature called the sea sheep. 🐑 https://t.co/AvIxGv4nOG 0.857 of the flock 🐏 https://t.co/gvhDgJPWUS Nice day in the bottom field https://t.co/WswVN7oTYR Spotty Ears and Butterbean https://t.co/tZ3bX78eFo LIVE on #Periscope: Morning sheep time  https://t.co/GXz9mGAtsA Something about the face of this parping blubberlord seemed familiar. #PS4share https://t.co/2ZPPBkO1nP LIVE on #Periscope: Evening sheep time  https://t.co/IsiSL14hG1 Shaun https://t.co/dYCjvCzJI9 Droopy Ears https://t.co/C2GR6dpr5W So this is what Giles gets up to when I'm in space of an evening. https://t.co/NUFkTUWVa3 I am in the curry house https://t.co/IRsAjgq2ie Five funny black and white zebras jogged past many quiet oxen.

Fun game: take an old computer mag, read the ads and at the same time play the games in emulators. Laugh at how the descriptions match up. how come the ASA didn't explode back in the 80s when a million people sold their shit character based Pacman versions as "arcade quality"? Jerry implementing his bucket strategy. https://t.co/CuPbxMpLGY A bucket meeting. https://t.co/l1i9ZToqDC Jerry, Herdy and Droopy Ears. https://t.co/zRRelnGVWJ LIVE on #Periscope: Afternoon sheep time  https://t.co/vUxsBBQF6L I must admit to being somewhat confounded by the "god rays" effect in CV1. Really, WTF?

There's nothing like that in PSVR. LIVE on #Periscope: Morning sheep time  https://t.co/HZVCfw1wbZ Stopped for a piss at the services. #PS4share https://t.co/HnX9KDmXTq Sunset over Novo Basingstoke #PS4share https://t.co/R6701TJLXc Which may seem trivial to all you other people's engine users but when you roll your own it's a big thing to be able to do that :) So nice to be able to code up stuff for PSVR then switch to a different instance of VS, build and have the Oculus version fall out :). LIVE on #Periscope: Sheep time restart  https://t.co/uH0ITdPzbu LIVE on #Periscope: Morning sheep time  https://t.co/e5WmtfRLQw This burly Vy'keen warrior had painted his entire outpost pink. #PS4share https://t.co/cctZUxazNl As a dude old enough to remember Apollo and how gutted we were when everyone lost interest.. we could have done with a Musk or two back then @skipai @digitalspy I already have nVidia Shield Portable, handheld entire 8/16 bit era including console, home computer and arcade :). LIVE on #Periscope: Evening sheep time  https://t.co/hDGPvSKq1L I will never concern myself with the opinions of anyone who says "lions do not concern themselves with the opinions of sheep". @retroremakes I profoundly wish I could develop without having to ever think about money.Nasty, horrible stuff that ruins things and people.

from gpiozero import *
def foo(): pass
b = Button(2)
b.pressed = foo

AttributeError: 'Button' object has no attribute 'pressed' @whaleygeek @martymcfly_phd That makes sense @whaleygeek Just happens to use lowercase like other built-in types. But other stdlib things like Decimal and Fraction cased like classes. @whaleygeek I know. Just made the (wrong) assumption that range was a function. It's actually a class/type. @whaleygeek @martymcfly_phd WHAT. I did not expect that to work... @DRMacIver Yeah I think it's just because other built-in types are lowercase. Because history. @MattersOfCS Sussed it now. They actually are classes, just lowercase like other built-in types like int, str, etc. @DRMacIver Ok that clears things up. My assumption they are functions was wrong. I think my query comes down to the way they're cased. @DRMacIver I guess so. Just confusing to look around if you're unfamiliar. Why are they types rather then classes? .@DRMacIver Inconsistent too. Fraction (ABCMeta (?)), Decimal (type, but cased like a class name), range (type), randint (method (?))... @MattersOfCS I know. But why not provide this as a Range class? Why choose to provide it as a function? (actually a type) I just reached a new level of not understanding. Ok so range, cycle, chain and datetime are all types, not functions. And randint is a method (?). @martymcfly_phd They would do the same thing, but there's a design decision there. Choice between the user using a function or a class. @whaleygeek I guess so. See next tweet. e.g. range() returns a range object, chain() returns a chain object. Why choose to design to provide functions rather than classes? The Python standard library provides functions which return objects of a class of the same name of the function. @helenlynn @charwarz Why?

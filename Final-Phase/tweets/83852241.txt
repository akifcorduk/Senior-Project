You should know Edith Ackermann - #FabLearn Lifetime Achievement award in 2016 https://t.co/mbLSQnkiTx @gallahergh but that's the idea. PBL requires learners to be able to focus on small things, and then integrate those to support larger goals @gallahergh @Learn21Tech that's a good fix! I meant micro &amp; macro, but autocorrect decided to make me slightly more profound. :) @gallahergh @Learn21Tech You're at Pomona. You know how to school. Seek out experts and observe how they learn, how they teach. @gallahergh @Learn21Tech Anything that adults do for love -not credit hours- reqs project frames to incorporate the craft into life. @gallahergh @Learn21Tech Any human-fufilling discipline will model the switch between micro&amp;inscribed that's at the heart of PBL. @gallahergh @Learn21Tech dance is great for this - samba, tango. Motorcycle clubs. Skate parks. Martial arts. @gallahergh @Learn21Tech yes! Don't look for teachers trying to teach how to teach. Look for craft communities with teachers @gallahergh @Learn21Tech Papert learned about learning from samba schools. At Constructionism 2016, saw same from breakdance communities. @gallahergh @Learn21Tech the right prep program is any active learning/craft community full of mentors. @JustinAion season 1?

Game design is a far, far more complex task than any G3 kids expects. Challenge is managing that. @Laotic Obv, as elem #makered, My kids work with stuff.

It was great seeing them on display in bookstores while I traveled the US this summer. @nathan_stevens @Learn21Tech hence why there are gap years and not "break" years. Gap exploits natural transition point. #isedchat @nathan_stevens @Learn21Tech Especially when we invest so much energy in the "class of XX" cohort in k-12. Really hard to break #isedchat @Learn21Tech Ps instinct is fear that the child is losing out/falling behind especially if they lose touch with their cohort #isedchat @Learn21Tech It could be a non-academic skill swap, akin to a week long "club."  Or it could be service/community based #isedchat A3: #isedchat has another great option- create a gap-year tuition structure. Hold your place, provide mentorship with faculty, reduce cost A3: A week of intense specialization in some non-class skill/process during the year is a good onramp for gap year #isedchat A3:  first step- start with a consistent, recurring chunk of non-class school each year (or semester!) #isedchat #isedchat These examples are individual choices. What can a school do to make that sort of experience a part of every student's path? #isedchat International schools sometimes see kids coming in from gap-year type experiences, especially when moving between hemispheres. A1: K-12 rarely goes in for anything at the "year" level. Winter term, hidden trimesters, that's far more common. #isedchat @nathan_stevens great to see you Nathan! @Learn21Tech There are innumerable incredible things for a community of learners to do besides class. #isedchat @Learn21Tech I'm around for a bit!

My thanks to @ZeinaChalich for the invitation to host and to the community at large. Wonderful to hear about so many new material experiences from  #makeredAU. If you're looking for more theoretical grounding in the tennents of #makeredAU, read some Mindstorms or The Children's Machine
#makeredAU @mpchristiner YES! Food matters. We just built our first portable kitchen station for the makerspace. #makeredAU @iMerinet This summer was the perfect storm, with Carla Rinaldi AT Constructing Modern Knowledge. #makeredAU @iMerinet Constructing Modern Knowledge every July in New Hampshire. Wherever @garystager is speaking next in Australia. #makerEDau @iMerinet I try not to spend any time on "how to" until there's a student developed idea to push forward. #makeredAU RT @HostBrian: A5. To be honest my mindset shifted when my Ss used many of the "old" crafts to explain the passions &amp; what makes them them‚Ä¶ @debsnet Thanks for that link! I love deep dives into the meaning and significance of materials. #makeredAU @ExtMath That's a good point. I have used LOGO more for my own learning in the last 2years than I have since I was 9. #makeredAU @iMerinet @makeymakey @maasmuseum Wonderful! A5 I felt connected to the designers of every puslsing rainbow sign or theme park parade. I had a window to backstage.

#makeredAU A5: For me, I think it was when I first worked with programable LEDs (NeoPixels or similar). #makeredAU With all that talk about how students interact with materials, Question 5 is about you. 

#makerEDau https://t.co/jhpIidNxha @ZeinaChalich Yes. I curate materials mroe when students have limited time. There is such a thing as unproductive frustration. #makeredAU @dothinkeducate We take a lot from Reggio and Montessori about the power of natural materials for all learners. #makeredAU @HostBrian Yes! My "what I do" line for admin is "Curate materials+Env that let students embody ideas they can't yet articulate." #makerEDau @mpchristiner Have you seen the amazing @TinkeringStudio at the ExploratoriumSF? Good mix of task-specific materials and open #makereAU A3: "Mouth down" often comes from trying to combine materials that just don't go. Wood with Lego. Taping to sheet plastic. #makeredAU A3: Mouth Up is engaged, solving a particular problem, trying solutions quickly.That means the materials are supporting learning

#makeredAU A3 I work with primary kids, so the big material challenge is finding ones that cause "mouth up" not "mouth down" frustration #makeredAU @regie87 So what are good materials? What kids of things have you seen create "good constraints"? #makeredAU @dothinkeducate ACPS in the US spends a lot of energy making "comfortable" universal. https://t.co/SyEApjeI45 #makerEDau @dothinkeducate I think "whatever is comfortable" is VERY specific. Comfort is personal, not standardized. #makerEDau @mpchristiner Is there a more oxymoronic phrase than "maker results" ? #makerEDau @dothinkeducate Wonderful;. We have a set of BeeBots for our K/1 kids. Spend a bunch of time Playing Turtle outside too. #makeredAU Q3: Papert asserts that we learn best through/with materials.Can  materials encourage metacognition?  #makeredAU https://t.co/BQ4pdfrfgf @mpchristiner That's a question I wonder about constantly! #makeredAU RT @mpchristiner: QŒ©: Just curious how do you feel #makermovement or #makerspace compare/differ in AU compared to EU &amp; US? #makeredAU @HostBrian I remember. The window between LOGO and desktop publishing was beautiful but tiny. #makerEDau A little background for question 3. One of Papert's most iconic and beautiful statements. https://t.co/NA7TB5YRMJ @dothinkeducate Yes! The key insight from Papert is that wanting to DO something is the most powerful motivator for learning. #makeredAU Although we all encountered LOGO in different years, it sounds like we were around the same age and share many experiences #makerEDau @mpchristiner Yep! LOGO is a huge family at this point, with tons of variants to serve many purposes. #makerEDau @deanpearman Ha! The question was about LOGO, but mad love for LEGO Space https://t.co/pj3NBx6z03 @angelaryall93 The best part about LOGO is that there's no risk of drowning. Open Scratch. Draw a house. It's where we all start. #makerEDau @regie87 Great! Thrilled to here it was still thriving for you in the 90s. #makeredAU @HostBrian Can I ask your age? Were you shooed away because others needed the comp, or because school wanted something else? #makeredAU @dothinkeducate Wow! Pixelated and college put huge gap between our first encounters. But I know there were more similarities. #makeredAU A2  I have clear memories of a LOGO station in my classroom in 1985, but know that word processing quickly took over the computer
#makeredAU @dothinkeducate Thought exercise: What does that imply about all other desks? What closes off those avenues in other spaces? #makerEDau After that, I think the best read is 20 Things to Do with a Computer, by Papert and @cynthiasolomon  
https://t.co/zAcu2mrY6Z
  #makeredAU Should I link-dump some of the Best-of-Papert? Start with the repository. @garystager 's Collection https://t.co/pghVA1Rsgn #makeredAU @dothinkeducate That's a powerful notion! Agency begets agency. Freedom inspires freedom. #makerEDau @angelaryall93 Let's consider you part of today's Luicky 10,000 https://t.co/DFQImRKD2u #makeredAU Question 2: What about LOGO? How many of us encountered LOGO without knowing the names behind it? https://t.co/WnHfbA2dm2 Sounds like there's a mix in our group of "new to me" and exposure through our EDU training, deepend through practice.
#makeredAU @dothinkeducate Ha! One of the powerful ideas I took form Papert was that learning was identical, regardless of the form. #makeredAU @HostBrian Do you remember now what you found so radical/discomforting about Papert's writings when you read them in school?
#makeredAU A1: The killer line for me was "First, you have to give up the idea of curriculum." 

#makeredAU @HostBrian Can you say a bit more? Certainly, Papert's works is filled with "get you kicked out of the faculty lounge" quotes.. #makeredAU @HostBrian Glad to have you here Brian! @angelaryall93 It's crazy! Learning about Papert as an adult is like disxocering the director&amp;crew standing just out of sight. #makeredAU A1: I ran across this video from early @edutopia, where Papert seemd to speak to my secret heart. 
https://t.co/4rVxPFYYxA

#makeredAU A1: I don't think I had heard Papert's name alound until about 5 years ago, as I started to bottom out in math teaching.
#makeredAU @dothinkeducate Hi Anna! Nice to meet you. Love to see another great threeword twitter handle. DO you know @DesignMakeTeach ? @Anneticipation @MakerEDau Hi Anne! Great to meet you. @mpchristiner Thanks for joining us!

Mons's Goblin Raiders @_sequoia that sounds good. You go first. :). Thanks again for the human connection to another perspective. @_sequoia ennh. I‚Äôm not comfortable with the use of ‚Äúsex‚Äù as an absolute term that means (essentially) Assigned At Birth @_sequoia ok. I recognize how you could read that. I see the same sentences as expressing ‚Äúcis lesbians don‚Äôt acknowledge me as female.‚Äù RT @octopushat: PSA: if you know someone who‚Äôd be OMG PERFECT! for that Smithsonian beer job, you don‚Äôt need to send them a link. Trust me,‚Ä¶ @GadaboutGreen thanks for the loop back. It is two cismen who read it as exploratory. Always con joys of how that limits my vision @_sequoia two boundaries: who an individual has sex with, who is accepted into the community of women @_sequoia I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll agree on this, but I appreciate the frankness and resilience of this discussion. @_sequoia fine to say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not a body I will sleep with‚Äù. Fucked to say‚Äúyou‚Äôre not a woman.‚Äù @_sequoia lesbians absolutely have the authority to define who they will or will not sleep with. @_sequoia Do you not see a difference between those two boundaries? I think that‚Äôs the core of our disagreement in this discussion. RT @nkjemisin: Predicted people like Trump back when he was "just science fiction." #BlackWomenDidThat #OctaviaButler https://t.co/FPolSFmQ‚Ä¶ @_sequoia In that frame(which Julia discusses at length elsewhere) it‚Äôs part of the same conversation as Michfest, or single-gender schools @_sequoia If you‚Äôre a woman and identify as a women, wouldn‚Äôt you like to have other women validate your identity? @_sequoia that‚Äôs the part that I can see as identity-denying, and you read as manipulative/bullying. Is that a fair summary? @_sequoia the point of the essay (as I read it) was that this rejection is equivalent to ‚ÄúI‚Äôm only attracted to real women.‚Äù @_sequoia it‚Äôs fair for anyone to say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want sex with‚Ä¶‚Äù for any reason. @_sequoia my practice (as a cismale) is to take stated gender identity as the top level identifier. Thanks for the discussion. @_sequoia I‚Äôm not clear on a practical distinction between ‚Äúfemale-bodied‚Äù and FAAB (or vice versa), but that may be irreconcilable. @_sequoia ok. I recognize the context in which you‚Äôre making that substitution. I don‚Äôt agree with the conclusions, but see the motivation. @_sequoia sorry! That‚Äôs how I read your consistent substitution of those terms.  Can you elaborate on your intent? @_sequoia Simoly - more cismen than queercis women seem to accept her identity as female. She explores that issue a lot in Excluded. @_sequoia No one is obligated to sleep with anyone. The essay aggregated behavior @_sequoia Is FAAB/MAAB the entire story of a person‚Äôs gender identity and expression?    By subbing male-bodied for transwoman, you say yes @_sequoia The essay was about the identity-denying practice you‚Äôre engaging in RIGHT HERE. @_sequoia that‚Äôs the third time you‚Äôve swapped trans for [male-bodied].  That‚Äôs the exact attitude under discussion @_sequoia have you read any of Julia‚Äôs other essays/books? This essay read as a very personal anecdote that reflect back on her larger  work RT @David_EHG: Those who see Clinton &amp; Trump as similarly dangerous equate oligarchy and fascism.

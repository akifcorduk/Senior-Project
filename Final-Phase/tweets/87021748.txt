States are harder to find (esp. If you don't live in U.S.) and very often aren't labeled. @acotgreave @sirvizalot @Harris7Curtis I'd prefer plain old small multiples or a non-geographic layout when geo. isn't relevant to the data RT @bencasselman: This isn't remotely how Venn diagrams work. https://t.co/TLFla2wREH @Harris7Curtis @sirvizalot basic small multiples work just as well since most of the time geo. isn't relevant.

Delete the calorie count that is recorded by one App...which by the way is always 20-30% different from the other. I want the route tracking that the 3rd party allows but the integration of the Apple Watch. Right now I have to do both then delete one. So what is the solution for using Apple Watch activity tracking but preferring 3rd party apps (ie cyclemeter)? Data is counted twice now. However, my iPhone battery has about 30% less power left. For the record, I'm 15 hours into my first full day with Apple Watch and I've got 56% left on the battery. There is no shortage of force in "force touch" on Apple Watch.

The insulating dough doesn't respond well to cold temp, though. @Rosieeatsjam In-use dough, on a museum floor, only lasts a couple of days, even when sealed between uses. We haven't tried freezing it! @Rosieeatsjam Freshly-made, unused, sealed dough keeps about 1 week refrigerated or room temp. Insulating dough gets "weird" in the fridge.

Our house has AC, humidity kept in check.

The PLA it comes with is that color @ChuckHellebuyck @newmatter it's a fan duct from LoboCNC on @thingiverse - yeah all prints have that texture so far. @CWCrawlers @newmatter everything off this printer has that texture so far. The Faceless model is current #3dprinting on the @newmatter MOD-t #3dprinter.

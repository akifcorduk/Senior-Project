Quite a few, anywhere between 4 or 5 at a time. https://t.co/F416Q6Jhb8 I got to build a test shot for the new 262, it's looking great the designers have done a brilliant job. https://t.co/rtDUPgz9ZQ I have to go soon but there's time for a few more. This has been fun. We all did, we all grew up making models. https://t.co/qdHsbri5T9 Good question. I certainly do, I try and choose the most interesting schemes possible. https://t.co/WXA1ttSHF0 Visit your local library, books are an invaluable resource for me. https://t.co/1TJ7gjNc2A Not at the moment, but that would be awesome! https://t.co/jTrM8CYqck Not a bad idea. Maybe in the future. https://t.co/ng0d6KP6q9 I love going on visits to museums and aircraft collections! https://t.co/mF846d2bBc No, but I sit next to the guy that did! I did the research and gave him the info he needed. https://t.co/rIQV4JWUex Roughly 12 - 18 months and it is ongoing right up until release. https://t.co/YDAJQUpjwQ Keep your questions coming in. I wish I could be more specific about future releases but I am making notes. #AirfixQandA We don't have any plans at the moment, but as always, never say never. https://t.co/VZiM7hZCfb Ahh the Vulcan, I am sure it will make a comeback in the future you'll have to wait and see. https://t.co/PSaOHMPEj1 Autumn next year we hope. This isn't 100% though. https://t.co/S40AAh44BB Keep an eye out, we'll have some more info on this coming soon. https://t.co/mLJcQP01Bo Maybe, you never know! https://t.co/uLyCHYt5V1 We actually find it is still the traditional Spitfires that generate the interest of younger demographics. https://t.co/l2lgWkHKy7 I'll certainly ask them about it. https://t.co/PYWRyluW9U 1) I do all the research for Airfix, nice to meet you. 2) The Victor, the P-40 &amp; the new Stuka are UK manufactured. https://t.co/ZFBMCsqTF6 The designers sit next to me. I’ll have a word with them. https://t.co/CMt0MiIAqH Unfortunately not. They have radically different fuselages so it’s impossible for us. https://t.co/UUCUuNvWAA Not at the moment, you never know though. https://t.co/dSYV1MorkO Possibly. You’ll have to wait and see. https://t.co/LsW9HrBAwT 1:12 Ferrari 312 PB would be nice :) But might be rather tricky… https://t.co/AEVb3McLFq 1) Thanks for the suggestion. 2) Whitley, Blenheim &amp; Defiant 3) Blenheim 4) HAC assisted with that project. https://t.co/nFMaVOV7SX Any other questions for me other than wishlists? I may be able to squeeze in a few more questions. Tanks may make a comeback one day, but in 2017, re-tooling aircraft is our focus. https://t.co/tUmXkyAlW5 I am sure they would and they are options we have considered… https://t.co/Fg6GgEiAjm Maybe in the future. You never know. https://t.co/afrsTKOADB Not such a well-known subject so at the moment there are no plans I'm afraid. https://t.co/E0AdMQLYSK Nice interesting suggestion, not thought of that one. I’ve made a note, you never know. https://t.co/C6ke8NiPZa A bit obscure for us, but thanks for the suggestion anyway, I’ve made a note. https://t.co/lj76zowKfm Not the Valiant, but I’m sure you’ll see an new Vulcan from us at some point in the future. https://t.co/8kNROFHQMf No plans at the moment, we’ll let the B-17G have its time in the sun first. https://t.co/OVMuuhaJGF Again, always exploring new options, so you never know. https://t.co/oLdEft2hDX No plans at the moment, but maybe in the future the SM79 might come back. https://t.co/Orvy0HmgIB We’re always exploring new options but at the moment I can’t comment on any future release plans. https://t.co/KlYFIiHEM9 Hey everyone!

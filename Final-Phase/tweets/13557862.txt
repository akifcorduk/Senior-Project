Everyone here at NYCR wants to watch the dark crystal... there are also people here who have never seen tron... OH NOES! and sneakers! Should it just randomly quote the movie hackers? Or should we actually use it for human communication?  That just doesn't seem interesting enough! It would say 10k Ohms. It would be a respondo bot. Could we set this up to automatically reply to NYCR resistor color codes so that when you went NYCR Brown Black Orange... Or should it be a chat bot? Eliza with a hacker personality? OK, daydreaming up things to do with this account... should we have it auto twitter everytime the word LED is published to the internet? Twice in fact. Yarr, NYCR back. beep: Etch-a-mouse:

I guess my version of fighting is to channel my energy to building. Building for resistance is still be considered fighting? @troy_s absolutely. but i believe it has been in various ways for decades. TV in every room == threat to community. 10) I realize that building community is a major part of how I get to build &amp; understand at the level I do now. I must live this value fully 9) I am a builder not a fighter. My response will be to strengthen and rebuild communities. I will create space for bonds to form. 8) I believe it is the systematic destruction of communities that got us to this place, and now my communities are under attack 7) Many of the people I found are not even in California, let alone from here. It turns out community isn't purely a function of geography. 6) I moved across this country to find more people I could build and understand with. I found them. Turns out many are not from this country 5) I value building things. building to give people joy, building to help people work. Building because it makes me feel human. 4) I value community. Connecting with people who share my values. Working w/ them, eating w/ them, learning w/ them. understanding them. 3) I value gaining understanding and sharing it. this I have pursued almost single-mindedly for more than 15 years. this is now under threat 2) what I've found is that I value a few things deeply, but I don't honor all of them the same. First, I value understanding. lately I've been examining my values to a depth I haven't attempted before. brought on by external forces that are threatening them. have your cake and eat it too: "D3 and Arrow Functions" by @yonester https://t.co/iyBZItFdrn RT @NadiehBremer: Living in SF and want to learn the (creative) #dataviz process, then come to my workshop! :D https://t.co/9SHEuRwCCK http‚Ä¶ RT @micahstubbs: Hilbert paths

See http://t.co/lTZXIINrKt http://t.co/4RZa9fLk28 @DavidFCox maybe ... if the company does not have to do the research by itself :-) @ComteHarebourg I don't now, what do you mean? @ComteHarebourg and that's my point :-) The question is, how to do it, I want to try, but no-one knows if it will work :-) My point is, we, #RepRap, still have a shot of being mainstream 3DP solution, if we wait, we will have to work hard for it as linux does now @Gruino It happens actually :-) Not money, but I have advantages with a lot of suppliers :-) @VikOlliver it might not turn into what I want, but great thing about #reprap is, it doesn not matter what a single person does ... @VikOlliver And that is completely fine. I believe my motivation is not money, I would turn douchebag long time ago if it was money ... @ituxcoza Sheet metal, 15x15,30cm buid volume, PLA, cheap and available as pre built product :-) @VikOlliver We have all kinds of printers, ready to be built everywhere. We just miss one, the one for plain consumers :-| Dont you agree? @colepower ... meaningfull and dont just fall into the history books :-) Which would be shame, when we have so much influence now! @colepower We, #reprap community, must produce something consumer level competitive, easy to use, on the side to remain meaningful ... @VikOlliver ... market, so its bit different. I sell printers only in czech, We are similar. You have to think globally ... @VikOlliver It is funny, as I had NZ guest at my flat today accidentally today. What I got from it, NZ is very isolated market ... @VikOlliver ... as I don't use #RepRap wiki anyway :-) @VikOlliver maybe it's just going to be a "regular" 3Dprntr, stating clearly it's based on #reprap, it doesnt matter anyway, as I dont ... Guys, I hope you take this as an brainstorming, nothing is carved in stone yet, I have i4 designed in my head, but that doesnt mean anthng. @MattStultz True, I know the EU market better, in US, companies buy makerbots as we dont have an alternative. I try to address that. @VikOlliver ... and retail branch serving general public, side by side :) @VikOlliver I don't think its going to be the only think. Both ways should live together, true, which I love doing the inovation, and ... @MattStultz but power of Open Hardware is, that if you but the hypothetical i4, you will be able to easily mod it to use 3mm direct drive @MattStultz I might be wrong, but most of my customers, small companies, want to print rigid stuff :-) @MattStultz but ppl selling printer and providing support deserves some profiz @MattStultz I think all those sub $300 just fuck up the market for their marketing, they deliver shit, and make ppl think its that cheap @MattStultz I always made the printers fr majority, I feel majority don't care about flexible materials, it's too hard because 1,75 anyway:( @VikOlliver Sure, I just feel most of the ppl who want that already did it, but we need something more accessible ... @Memosis I appreciate you compliment, but the point is, how to make #reprap sustainable, not to make my name immortal :-) @amatecha I agree with you and we have many great self built designs, i3, Mendel90... :) We just have to be accessible for greater audience! @htxtafrica What I imagine is consumer printer, with "All of this is possible thanks to RepRap community" on the back label :-) @Aisflou first company which comes to my mind is RepRapDiscount, they might seem like chinease leaches, but thy cm frm EU and are TRUE! It is funny tho, as my name, even a lot of ppl don't realize it's someones name became a brand and ppl trust it :-) "Prusa approved" sounds too cocky, suggest some alternative guys :-) Fortunately I don't need to make money of it. And one important thing I would like to make, is some quality assurance. "Prusa approved" stamp or whatever, just so ppl can trust it ... I think, all those sub $300 printers are just splash and those companies die, as the simply can't make profit and support for customers. So i4 plan. Sheet metal, bowden, 1,75mm, easy to mass manufacture not self built unfortunately, but I hope for under $700 final cost @matoushybl ... everyone usually posts only negative feedback :-( @matoushybl Thanks man, this kind of words keep me moving. Mostly you do get only negative feedback, it can be hard sometimes, everyone ... @troysk704 true, I just want to move that idea to manufacturing, but no-one did that before :-) @troysk704 I think now only about one condition, guys I help to produce it, should sell it's parts for reasonable price to everyone :-) @troysk704 Now I would like to make design for production, and help everyone make fully assembled printer. @troysk704 ... you have many breeds, I actually have no control off and they make 99% of i3 built. @troysk704 Honestly,I can make a good first idea of the printer, community then polishes it and it evolves by itself, as with i3.You have... @Aisflou and I got the feeling the if at least branch of #reprap wont go fully assembled machine, we will bw forgotten @Aisflou its easy to make mass kits, but not mass fully assembled printers :-| Unfortunately, thats what market wants ... @matoushybl closing the source? LOL Never, my plan is to make easy to mass manufacure printer and help everyone make it @VikOlliver I am too lazy to try to make all the printers by myself, so the same story should never happen :-) @Dippyskoodlez I know Jebba @lulzbot3D, hes true. He hs put all his frtn on the line. He is crazy and I love him for it! @Dippyskoodlez That is true, we all started it. It just don't feel right to me, that some phony companies should get the reward for our work @Dippyskoodlez @troysk704 @VikOlliver  At the beginning, when no-one care what I do, it was free. And only now I learned to appreciate it :( @VikOlliver @troysk704 @Dippyskoodlez Unfortunately I got to the point, I am cautious about what I do, not to piss someone off :-( @Dippyskoodlez @troysk704 It is really hard for me, as #RepRap community defines who I am, without the community I would be no-one. @whosawhatsis I was in contact with @eff earlier about afinia case, I'm glad they are around :-) Hopefully we can do something :-| @VikOlliver Maybe it wont be true #RepRap, but a tool on the side to keep community alive! @VikOlliver I meet a lot of ppl, and they dont know #RepRap, but only the kickstarter bullshit, built upon our work :-( I want change @VikOlliver I dont mean to make money of it, but someone has to provide printers for sale, which look competitive for regular ppl. @VikOlliver It is hard truth, but #RepRap is slwly going dwn!

I can help ;-) send me DM @johnnytrapano free iPhone5 comes only with orders over 1M€ :-) So sir, how do you want your 14290 frames delivered? ;-) @clothbot that Y stage kinda looks like a quadcopter frame :-) So finally got some i3 RepRap frames in stock, milled from 6mm dural with pre-tapped holes. I can sell them for 70€ http://t.co/7lcQblmm @stepanb That awkward moment, when you use more hair spray then your wife does :-D #reprap RT @geekshop: Nestíháte vánoční nákupy, nechce se vám do offline světa?

Guys who come to open source project and take from it, without returning anything :-/ RT @Dishcz: Jak na burgry s @josefprusa http://t.co/ZtK9dxMv @wjsteele exactly :-) RT PLS! Makes me sad when ppl support GPL only when it suits them. They like taking, but when they have to return "it's theft" ... fuck you @wjsteele trademark your name, which would allow you to stop 100% clones @wjsteele sorry that is no excuse to take GPL and make it CC NC or similar. Which I see as same thing as you are trying to prevent, theft :) @mbanzi @wjsteele YEAH! @wjsteele and any other license then GPL wouldn't allow others to do what you've done with Makerbot/Ultrabot @wjsteele In MB case it's just excuse and closed sourcing wont help a thing. I talked on the same topic with @mbanzi, cloners don't care. @wjsteele I am not fan of this arrangement. Much smaller resolution on edges then in center for example. Also CC-NC sux. @wjsteele I asked because there is prior art with this axis arrangement in RepRap, so you can't patent it. I've read that you patented PiMaker @wjsteele can you tell us more?

No PC, PEEK and Nylon printing :-( @bodynek 0.35 soon! 1.75 maybe in the future, I'm not a big fan of it as its weak and tangle. And we now have direct drive extruders for 3 RT @ellindsey: @josefprusa Well, I know what the next new part I'm buying for my printer will be now. Official new Prusa Nozzle website! BTW check out the pixel-art favicon ;-) http://t.co/mh2ZhW30 #RepRap @SallyRepRap nice Prusa Mendel kit ;-) #reprap @hoeken how does MBOT compare to Makerbot? :-) RT @hoeken: Got home safe and sound and was greeted by my new MBOT.

MiracleGrue isn't so miraculous, if you set high quality in MakerWare, it still uses old Skeinforge (which is AGPL in closed src SW #FAIL) @dsjunnesson @sparkfun, @adafruit, @arduino, Lulzbot what the hell even my company is doing really really well :-) None of them has VCs :-D @dsjunnesson of course it is possible :-) excuses excuses excuses I wonder how long would @makerbot be bluffing if I wouldn't do my rant http://t.co/zSOQXN88 I guess just till the end of @ohsummit and MFNYC @hoeken still not coming to @ohsummit?

Looking forward to meet you! AWSM! RT @NetSynth: @josefprusa IMHO, Prusa Mendel is the most wide spread RepRap machine already among OSHW worldwide.

Or was it before already? #reprap @bre @ObjectsUnltd I know it's a problem with RepRap.

But I smell investors ... So I called @makerbot support and asked. Replicator 2 is NOT Open Source! #FAIL #reprap :-( I'm sad! /cc @bjepson @adafruit @make @hackaday Oh @tinkercad is now paid :-/ Pay me $499.99 a month and I'll leave you in my http://t.co/EJRJrLOh #IamSAD Any alternative?

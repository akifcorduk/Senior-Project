Much patience, separate subtle from gross, yada yada. @t3dy @cole_tucker Nope. You're looking for a silver bullet, a one-size fits all solution. @t3dy @cole_tucker Interesting.  Scribe proves he writes in multi sizes, has standard hand, can do diagrams &amp; basic illustration, drop caps. @t3dy @cole_tucker The Principles? The principles of design? or the principles of magic? or the principles of book production? @t3dy @cole_tucker a master copy like your own grimoire, for example. :-) @t3dy @cole_tucker You would do better to learn five or six really intimately, and reproduce the others by hand as needed from a master copy @t3dy @cole_tucker Which is kind of my point — the magicians kept drawing skills alive in middle ages, then shifted to new tech.... @t3dy @cole_tucker time to take a drawing class, then; &amp; classes in printing.  These are masterwork materials, no? @t3dy @cole_tucker Did Fludd do his own illustrations? or did Maier/DeBry do them? I'm confused about that myself. @t3dy @cole_tucker My guess is a combination — result of strong drawing skills developed in relative secrecy within the scribal community? @t3dy @cole_tucker so who did the illustrations? the magi themselves? Or their students? a hired hand? @t3dy @cole_tucker what's your interest in design? what's your interest in magic? How/where do they intersect for you? @t3dy @cole_tucker You're welcome.  Look at kamea as well &amp; new-script emergence like Theban &amp; Angelic characters.  Remember to draw, too. @t3dy @cole_tucker It's hard to know w/o looking at orig. grimoire manuscripts. But some seals appear to teach geometry, other scribal arts. @t3dy @cole_tucker https://t.co/R7SK9u7LkA Here's the rules for page harmony.  Also Andrew Sutton, "Ruler &amp; Compass" by Wooden Books. @t3dy @cole_tucker &amp; there's a drawing curriculum built into astrological image magic, e.g https://t.co/X8ME3L6GiJ @t3dy @cole_tucker No. But there's the laws of page harmony, which medieval manuscripts obeyed. @cole_tucker @t3dy There is. Because calligraphy, visual thinking, &amp; scribal arts were part of the secret magical curriculum Tai Chi Y4D305: four and rites https://t.co/I6zERlgywu https://t.co/jLqndJg4qe 31DoM: Use Tarot Cards https://t.co/GRg2Qkxjqd https://t.co/mR6ehH64Ut @Hawaiianimages @AliceDreger by way of intro, here's my blog: https://t.co/N5Rmf9gNM0. Check out 2 posts back on servitors. @Mr_Hutchinson_ they designed it... We'll see Thursday if it builds right. @AliceDreger @Hawaiianimages don't rush out and get a tattoo of this motto any time soon. @AliceDreger @Hawaiianimages ubi CAUSUS. Hard to type Latin when autocorrect English is on. @Mr_Hutchinson_ one of my student teams designed a Greek temple piggy bank using phi and Pythagoras. Did I miss all of tonight's conversation on  #CTedu ? I was presiding at a toastmasters meeting instead. @AliceDreger @Hawaiianimages "Ubi casus accidet, scientias corripete." carries the idea of accident, occurrence, &amp; 'trial ready knowledge'. @AliceDreger "Ubi causus accidet, corripete scientias." — when a cause/event happens by accident, y'all go gather trial-ready knowledge.

Sort of a commandment to self. @Hawaiianimages @AliceDreger for a motto, probably a command... But maybe more active indicative and personal? @Hawaiianimages @AliceDreger also, data as what goes in a spreadsheet, or more general "information"? @AliceDreger @Hawaiianimages Latin distinguishes between indicative &amp; imperative, or "this is what is done" and "do this or else". :-) @AliceDreger @Hawaiianimages as in, "when an incident occurs, you grab data."  Or "when an incident occurs, you: grab data! @AliceDreger @Hawaiianimages and grab, as a command to the person who reads it? @Hawaiianimages @AliceDreger and do you mean data as a singular or as a plural? Is the incident passive or actively occurring? @Hawaiianimages @AliceDreger do you mean, seize like grabbing a tool, or seize like swarming your troops into a town? @Hawaiianimages @AliceDreger is "seize" supposed to imply imperative/command/order? @Hawaiianimages @AliceDreger oh.  Hmmm.  I'll see what I can do.

That's how the chess set came to be, really. @nathan_stevens I said "string theory": that was popular 4 me: make knitting &amp; braiding tools in carpentry next learn to knit &amp; weave. @love4thgrade @nstifel #ctedu Please visit. Just schedule in June so I know when to be around. I'm not home much in summers. @Mr_Hutchinson_ #ctedu The school is in Middlefield. DO you know the Eli Whitney Museum, though? Have you been?? @nstifel #makered I think we can all learn a lot from Eli Whitney Museum: great #ctedu resource, actually—MakerSpace disguised as a museum! @nstifel #makered that's one of my goals too.  Let's check in to see our progress in a few months, &amp; see how that's going, &amp; what's working. @Mr_Hutchinson_  you're in CT? Depending on where, I could meet you next week; or you could come to see the Design Lab.  #ctedu @DesignMakeTeach But it's also good #makered if you learn to use 2 new tools, and 5-6 old tools in new ways. @DesignSaunders @Mr_Hutchinson_  #makered I love the idea of MakeyMakey, don't have any yet.  I want more teachers onboard for electronics. @Mr_Hutchinson_ #ctedu and then they can have a conversation about why spaghetti and marshmellows aren't ENOUGH to teach these skills.... @Mr_Hutchinson_ #ctedu it teaches cooperation, limitations of tools &amp; materials, time limits, structural integrity, and more. @Mr_Hutchinson_ Have parents build a tower of spaghetti &amp; tape w/ 1 marshmellow at the top.  Tallest tower wins. @Mr_Hutchinson_ #ctedu You can do the marshmallow challenge. :-) @love4thgrade #makered how did you build the green screen?  I want to do that soon. @DesignSaunders #makered my goal is metal casting within two years. Faculty want a "design trophy"; I want the kids to design it, make it! @DesignSaunders @Mr_Hutchinson_ @jgmac1106 @thenerdyteacher #makered I wish we still had a functioning print shop. That would be awesome. @DesignSaunders #makered they learn graphic design along the way from Robin Williams, the graphic designer not actor. @DesignSaunders @Mr_Hutchinson_ @jgmac1106 @thenerdyteacher #makered My Computer class designs our yearbook, start to finish. #makered "String Theory" class: make knitting needles, lucet, inkle loom, &amp; spindle. Learn to turn wool roving into yarn, into scarf, etc. @Mr_Hutchinson_ @jgmac1106 @thenerdyteacher #makered a printer parent brought in trays of moveable type; we made paper w/ Ss; &amp; bound books. @Mr_Hutchinson_ @jgmac1106 @thenerdyteacher #makered Seriously, though: they often need the skills-building as much as the kids. @Mr_Hutchinson_ @jgmac1106 @thenerdyteacher #makered We have separate times for them until they get the hang of not interfering.  :-) RT @nathan_stevens: @AndrewBWatt @robpennington9 @thenerdyteacher @DesignSaunders really?? I am looking and lusting after the storage #make… @nathan_stevens @robpennington9 @thenerdyteacher @DesignSaunders #makered did you see our storage? #ctedu https://t.co/kUE6aW4E5d @robpennington9 @thenerdyteacher @DesignSaunders #makered #ctedu quote is good; a part is worth 1k pictures— a machine is work 10k parts! @robpennington9 @thenerdyteacher @DesignSaunders #makered #ctedu I'm happy for the button making machine more than the quote. That's good! @KateGagner #ctedu #Makered I hope it was helpful! @smartinez #ctedu #makered wasn't that fun?? Hi, Sylvia. RT @nathan_stevens: The main thing about #makered is that it is not stem focused. Maker covers all subject areas  #CTedu @jgmac1106 @thenerdyteacher sometimes the compass and straightedge. #makered is a great way to teach geometry, I've found. :-) #ctedu @thenerdyteacher #ctedu because when they're using the higher-risk tools, that's especially when we want to get out of the way. :-) @thenerdyteacher #ctedu and sometimes we need to direct their learning, so that they learn to use tools with higher risk factors. RT @thenerdyteacher: Sometimes we (teachers) just need to get out of their (students) way and let them explore and learn. #ctedu @nathan_stevens  #ctedu Sure. All FabLabs are makerspaces, but not all MakerSpaces are FabLabs. :-) @MrsSmith167 @nathan_stevens #ctedu A solution built with 2x4s looks very different than one with popsicle sticks! @MrsSmith167 @nathan_stevens Not just tools, remember— materials, too. Materials determine structure determine solution-space. @iplante @DesignSaunders @edcampct I'm at a family reunion that day.  But I'll host a workshop for teachers in October through @CAISCT (totally! But we also must teach the skills that go with the tools we have, while lobbying for the tools we want.) https://t.co/4M7OacrR4R @peghob #ctedu Not yet, anyway. What I'm saying is, a MakerSpace can't Make everything: it's limited by its toolset and materials stores. @peghob #ctedu one of my girls learned to weld... but I don't want a welding machine in my MakerSpace. RT @DesignSaunders: @jluss @joshburker Invent to Learn is a must-read, IMO. #ctedu @peghob #ctedu Parents support motivated students, yes. Materials dictate what can be built, tools dictate how materials are shaped. @peghob #ctedu If your MakerSpace has sewing machines but no 3D printer, that sets parameters/borders for Making. Likewise the reverse. @nathan_stevens #ctedu absolutely! @nathan_stevens #ctedu Yeah, but most kids don't cut or burn themselves on an iPad. @nathan_stevens #ctedu a journal of what one learns as well as diagrams of built or parts to be built is useful. Show your work! @nathan_stevens #ctedu Some assessment is skills based: can you saw correctly? Some is about Maker vision: world-helping process or toy? @nathan_stevens #ctedu I'll know more at the end of this year. Assessment starts this fall! Q4: What resources or communities would you recommend to others seeking more information re: #makerspaces? #CTedu @peghob #ctedu I find that kits work best for K-4, projects for 5-8, and Make: magazine recommended self-directed projects for high school. Q3:   How should a #makerspace connect to the larger curriculum? What about assessment? #CTedu @nathan_stevens @MrsSmith167 #ctedu saw, chisel, drill, soldering iron need different training, learning goals than glue gun &amp;  scissors. @nathan_stevens @MrsSmith167 #ctedu open ended projects are fine, sometimes. But you'll also need to teach /skills/. @peghob #ctedu Remember: your MakerSpace's tools, materials, and how-to resources determine what students can build. @MrsSmith167 #ctedu you encounter different problem-types when imagining a thing than when you're building it. It can't just be ideas alone. @MrsSmith167 #ctedu Ideally, I'll teach students 10+ origami folds, 2-5 pop-up card mechanics, some architectural cuts, and more. @peghob #ctedu it's easy to turn a MakerSpace into another art room. But it ultimately needs to teach kids to think about machines &amp; tools. @peghob #ctedu clay is good — wood is better but requires a broader range of tools, experience, and safety protocols. @MrsSmith167 #ctedu e.g, this summer I'm learning 25+ origami 4 a class on Engineering with Paper: pop-up books, kirigami, simple machines. @MrsSmith167 @thenerdyteacher #ctedu No, that's my professional development. Then the skills come into play to show kids in the MakerSpace. @TeamEaglesRead @MrsSmith167 @thenerdyteacher Agreed, and that's a great book too to get teachers on board as well. #ctedu PRototyping and imagining are very different: one is creating the idea, and the other is creating the thing itself. #ctedu but it's not strictly necessary.  Mostly what you must do is help kids separate the criticism from the expansion of their design. #CTEdu It's nice to have a process for understanding Design Thinking; my school's is here: http://t.co/ipubomVQFx @thenerdyteacher #ctedu Adafruit is a great resource for learning to build and Make electronics kits, building blocks for future tinkering. @thenerdyteacher #ctedu A lot depends on your learning style. I'm a book learner, so I do a lot of how-to books: origami, mechanics. @jluss #ctedu it's often difficult to get them to STOP. But building in clean-up time is essential to MakerSpace success, whoever is there. @peghob #ctedu What about maskmaking? and cultural connections to masks and masques in global studies? @peghob That's brilliant. Wearables are a great idea. Do you teach sewing machines? Patterns on hand? Costume workshops in October? #ctedu @Ida_Librarian #ctedu I think it can be done.  A MakerSpace's leader's 1st job is to become a Maker themselves at least in their own school. @DesignSaunders #ctedu They can have Legos, or robots, or popsicle sticks and glue, or electronics parts. they're places to learn-by-doing. @DesignSaunders #ctedu a MakerSpace is a space with tools and materials, where kids and adults "build in order to learn." @DesignSaunders #ctedu but they don't always groove on the literature or abstract mathematics programs that are at the core of education. @DesignSaunders #ctedu what I mean is— I think that MakerSpaces serve an important group in schools, our innovators and engineers. @DesignSaunders #ctedu Kids who are bad spellers are often good builders — and my spelling skills have declined as I've learned to Make. :-) @robpennington9 #ctedu and then both the kid, and I, understood how force pumps worked. The same is true of trains, or drill presses. @robpennington9 #ctedu it's also true for us as adults.  I built a model of a force pump from cardboard tubes my first week on the job. @robpennington9 #ctedu not just innovation. "What you make with your hands, you build in your mind." What kids build, they understand better @atragg #ctedu I understand.  Maybe you can design a better one.  I think you can do that. @Ida_Librarian #ctedu what skills are you bringing to the table? What tools do you intend to have? @Ida_Librarian #ctedu YOUR training have as much to do with the success of your MakerSpace as the tools that you have. #ctedu The Design Lab just finished a major overhaul after 5 years, and it's made a huge difference in our program. I'm the DesignLab director at Independent Day School, Middlefield, CT #ctedu We've had the Design Thinking program since 2010. Reference materials at hand #ctedu for tonight's maker space conversation http://t.co/DROjzrFx7w 59... 58... 57... 56... #ctedu @atragg @teespring Also, you're using Arial as the font, right? Is that the best choice for a historic state like Connecticut?  #ctedu @atragg @teespring Is it the photo or the image? @atragg @teespring Connecticut looks squashed in that picture— too wide relative to height; or too short relative to width. #ctedu RT @robpennington9: We’re 13 min away from #CTedu and we’re talking MakerSpaces with guest moderators @DesignSaunders @AndrewBWatt @thenerd… Or maybe #CTEdu MakerSpace folks would like to join the Make Summer Camp movement? http://t.co/hMlktp5Q0j For MakerSpace folks on tonight's #CTedu, you might want to check out initial reflections I wrote a few days ago: http://t.co/U9cb6V2H3o I'm on point for #ctedu and their talk about MakerSpaces tonight. @DesignSaunders @thenerdyteacher unable to add questions right now; but "self-training as makerspace leader."

Lucky to get 3prints/day @lieberrian #makered OH YES! I'm tired of finding a 2" circle cut out of MIDDLE of a 24"x48" sheet of foamboard!

"Tools" vs. "tool like objects (TLO)", TLOs look like tools, but they don't really work #makered @christinalaoshi Also: metric or inches. Managing both is a real hassle for building tool-sets, keeping screws/bolts/washers, etc. #makered @christinalaoshi #makered My carpenter friends say, "buy the tools you use."  Better to learn/master small groups of tools. @DianaLRendina @lblanken #makered the how-to library keeps getting bigger, doesn't it? Every year, more cool books to add! @lblanken Used to love NuevaSchool. Now love mine, because I built it. #makered I can reproduce any furniture in it with its toolset. @lblanken @christinalaoshi Right. We ran #makered in room w/ leftover furniture for 5 years before moving into new workshop. Take your time. @christinalaoshi #makered I'm reading Chris Schwarz's book ANARCHIST'S TOOL CHEST, incl. info on ID'ing good quality tools &amp; their care. @christinalaoshi #makered Remember: there are "tools" and "tool-like objects" which look like tools but don't actually work. @lblanken #makered I say, "give me the money, and it will look futuristic for a week until we cover it with dust again." @christinalaoshi @nstifel #makered an engineer told me, "build it in cheap, cheap materials first, before you spend a fortune on parts." @nathan_stevens @DianaLRendina @lblanken David Hewlett of Hewlett-Packard said "everything great begins in a garage," something like that. @nathan_stevens @lblanken #makered Still collecting equipment fr yard sales, etc! @DianaLRendina @lblanken #makered You can indeed.

"making happens w/ cardboard &amp; glue" &lt;-- dive deep in 1-2 materials, amazing things result. @nathan_stevens A MakerLab produces makers. And makers know how to use tools solo and in sequence/combos, on materials, to build/make/create @nathan_stevens #makered and learning to understand how differing materials behave under different tools &amp; conditions, matters. @nathan_stevens #makered I don't disagree: questions vital!  Yet stuff is built of materials: mined, milled, melted, molded, machined (1/2); @nathan_stevens #makered 4) evidence of aesthetics. Does student care what end product looks like? Does student look for beauty in end goal? @nathan_stevens #makered 3) geometry &amp; measurement: do geometry, measurement, ruler, protractor, multimeter play a role in Ss' build? @nathan_stevens #makered 2) evidence of tools mastery: does student use available tools effectively, both alone &amp; in combo with other tools? @nathan_stevens #makered 1) evidence of materials mastery; does student work w/ or vs. the strengths/weaknesses of the physical materials? @nathan_stevens I have four criteria now, which is more than I had a week ago. #makered Fortunately I'm not giving grades yet. :-) @nathan_stevens  I made lots ere I saw a path to how to construct grading in #makered — it was just last week: http://t.co/YoOEt6kjG7 #makered Schwarz distinguishes between "tools" and "tool-like objects", &amp; with good reason: new hand tools are oft badly-made or unworkable. #makered currently reading Chris Schwarz's guide to tools (and the box to build to put them in!), THE ANARCHIST'S TOOL CHEST. #makered here's our finished buildout: http://t.co/NFyKNWVYWk (missing link from last tweet!) #makered here's the finished build-out of our Makerspace... not fully arranged yet, but it's getting there. @nathan_stevens #makered maybe not power tools, but hand tools I hope:  squares, levels, drills, saws, all adjust a makerspace's capacity. #makered yes, you need a circle of Makers, but you need more than Q-tips and glue; flush cut saws, eggbeater drills &amp; bits change the game. @nathan_stevens @NMHS_lms We only have one quadcopter.

Here's skills to build that: you do it." @nathan_stevens @pritchclaire in a Make magazine book, I read about dividing #makered into classes: K-4 build kits; grades 5-8 do projects. @lblanken @RyanBarnes @briebdaley (2/2) #makered one in the new Design Lab building physical things, one in the comp. lab building digital. @lblanken @RyanBarnes @briebdaley Applause! I'm stealing your ideas, and seeking division of Compsci class time into 2 semesters (1/2) @lblanken @emilyletras You can come see our #Makered space, too... it should be finished soon: http://t.co/MHymj46kes @lblanken @emilyletras I will visit: I want to see this place... the photos were great. how's mid-June? @lblanken Aha! finally read your profile! Were you #naisac, or just your colleagues? @lblanken So do we make the projects more complex in response to the increase in the number of minds@work in a given #makered situation? @lblanken @emilyletras Hi Emily #makered @ Baldwin School is supposedly amazing... saw a workshop with them at #naisac on Feb. 27. Near you? @lblanken Kids want to build their things, not someone else's. Finding balance between 'my project' &amp; 'our project' is tricky #makered @lblanken Excellent! We've had a number of team-building programs in our #makered, but it's tough at times. Evening, all.  I'm hoping to find the #makered people tonight.

How goes? @MakerMOC you will! #makered  you'll have to try to persuade them to give up their scrap wood. Let me know how that goes. #makered I think I'm done for tonight. I got a lot of good ideas. @MakerMOC private. But there's builders and house framers and wall boarders and roofers. Lots of folks know stuff. #makered @MakerMOC @RyanBarnes #makered put a notice in your school parent newsletter. You'll have three by the end of the week. @MakerMOC @RyanBarnes #makered I'm at a school &lt;150 kids... We had ten parent volunteers. RT @tieandjeans: @AndrewBWatt @MakerMOC Define cutting zones. Here’s our box cutter zone. When cutting, no one else in blue #makered http:/… @MakerMOC @RyanBarnes #makered find a carpenter parent. Your best resource! I learned more in 3 hrs building tables than in 10 books. @MakerMOC @RyanBarnes @lblanken #makered so don't use with students; but do use it to prep for students to work, by cutting parts &amp; prepping @MakerMOC @RyanBarnes @lblanken #makered I built a sawhorse easily with circular saw but wouldn't hand it to a kid in a century. @MakerMOC @RyanBarnes @lblanken #makered you use circular saw to shape parts for kits when speed matters; they use hand saws for precision. @MakerMOC @RyanBarnes @lblanken #makered you should have it and get familiar with it. Ask real carpenter to show you to make straight cuts. @smartinez bye Sylvia! @RyanBarnes @MakerMOC @lblanken I have some good japanese style saws, coping saws, hacksaws. Teach kids correct saw and technique #makered @MakerMOC @lblanken @RyanBarnes circular saws? Yes. Don't. #makered I work with fourth and fifth graders. @RyanBarnes @MakerMOC @lblanken I wanted kids to be able to rebuild a workshop at school, at home, with a trip to the lumber yard. #makered @MakerMOC @lblanken @RyanBarnes you can build your own furniture cheaply for workshop space: http://t.co/KJzGjGJLFO #makered @MakerMOC @lblanken @RyanBarnes square doweling, round doweling, plywood. Not much above 1x4 in size. Yet. @nathan_stevens @MakerMOC @lblanken @RyanBarnes #makered not an Arduino problem. A bad motor inside. Must disassemble, remove, replace. @MakerMOC @lblanken @RyanBarnes #makered designing 3d parts - steep learning curve; sculpting wood - shallow learning curve &amp; forgiving @MakerMOC @lblanken @RyanBarnes buy tools you need not what you want. I have broken 3d printer but handdrills &amp; saws get used daily #makered @smartinez and I got to say "I'm in that." @smartinez nice to see you! I was startled the other day when someone held up yr book at a workshop on Fri and said "you have to read this!" @lblanken @MakerMOC @RyanBarnes #makered that see/do/teach model is how I teach tool-specific skills now. @lblanken @MakerMOC @RyanBarnes I saw leads @ wood workshop call students to learn drill, chisel in small groups: see, do, teach. #makered @smartinez @Learn21Tech really wrong verb! Design DOing? design manipulating? #makered @lblanken @RyanBarnes 35 min is not enough time. Some teachers need that much to explain what we're making in #makered ! @RyanBarnes @nathan_stevens @Learn21Tech resetting the workshop is so satisfying though— esp. Now that everything has a place. #makered @lblanken @RyanBarnes @nathan_stevens @Learn21Tech #makered 1.5 hrs in afterschool blocks, MTTh; 50 min in school 2days/week @Learn21Tech #makered but my failures taught me how to teach DT successfully. I couldn't have taught it without those mistakes. @Learn21Tech DT? It's v. abstract. I had to become a Maker to understand it. By then, colleagues were annoyed with my failures. #makered @RyanBarnes @nathan_stevens @Learn21Tech I make cleanup part of  #makered. Teaches kids where tools go, how to set room for what's next. @lblanken @Learn21Tech #makered we have to iterate our own projects and teach other teachers to do them, too, so they get better. @RyanBarnes @Learn21Tech I don't coach students to fail. But I do a task once, and then they have to do it themselves after that. #makered @lblanken @RyanBarnes have to teach the tools for #makered and that means tinkering and messing around a bit. @Learn21Tech @RyanBarnes @nathan_stevens @lblanken right. Our DT framework: http://t.co/6RZhTREM5O #makered @Learn21Tech @RyanBarnes @nathan_stevens @lblanken we teach kids that different parts of a project use different kinds of thinking. #makered @Learn21Tech @RyanBarnes @nathan_stevens @lblanken do you have a frame/manifesto? #makered @Learn21Tech @RyanBarnes @lblanken finding clients is difficult? Or in-house clients like musical's program, posters and publicity? #makered @lblanken weather, though— it's put me a month behind on finishing that wizard of oz puppet head, though. #makered @Learn21Tech @RyanBarnes @lblanken I've found its better to do one project in a quarter than to try for two. #makered @Learn21Tech @lblanken @davegray another great book, yes. But Gamestorming is outofbox for schools, like Dtforeducators is for business. @lblanken that empathy component is really important in DT. Easy to design for self; harder for others. #makered @lblanken @Learn21Tech I recommend GameStorming by Sunni brown and @davegray for faculty mtgs. #makered @Learn21Tech you can build to blueprints with maker skills; but to use plans + inspiration = DT. :-) #makered @Learn21Tech #makered DT are abstraction skills we use to solve concrete maker problems. I've tried to do DT w/o makery... But it's harder. @lblanken #makered building furniture for our new workshop space: adapting plans from 5' long workbench to 13' @lblanken quite a lot. Building a head for Wizard in Wiz of Oz. Got some ideas from instructables, but piloting blind, making it up.

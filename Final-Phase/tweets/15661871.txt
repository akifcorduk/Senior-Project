Firmly let your fellow citizens know you stand 4 humanity &amp; harm reduction. Despite hyperbole, POTUS is not a dictator yet. Voting &amp; peaceful, rigorous protest is how to get message of inclusivity &amp; tolerance across. 4 those telling me to stay out of politics (because it's not my area of expertise)- that argument died forever when TRUMP WAS ELECTED. 4 those about to unfollow, If u voted Trump, I understand u wanted a safer country/ better future.

(it's on in the other room) @JamieNoTweet Dave's doing so many things in his head before he pulls the trigger. It's astonishing. #MythBusters .@jamienotweet’s technique was to review each of his attempts on high speed and then adjust his body to minimize movement. #MythBusters Clearly I’m a fan of Bugs Bunny and the whole whoop boink exit stage right move. #Mythbusters It was hilarious watching @jamienotweet dodge imaginary bullets. He was right out of the Matrix. #MythBusters RT @Sci_Phile: If Buster pulled 500g, Buster momentarily felt as if he was 60,000+ pounds.

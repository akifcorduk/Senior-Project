You're being trained by AI whether you know it or not. 9/

https://t.co/WspodKASmO 8/

Every voice UI is training you to speak more clearly to it, which is nice if you create voice UIs, but a shame for the rest of humanity. 7/

What Google Now does‚Ä¶now is it asks "Do you want to send this or change it?"

You'll say "Send it" not "Yes" https://t.co/rWlXCewRg2 6/ 

You can create a voice system that listens for Yes. But YES is a tough word. And you don't want to send a text message by mistake. 5/ 

This inability to understand single words drives humans crazy because we understand context and are listening for yes/no etc. 4/

Super-short single word responses are a great way to totally fuck over a voice system. 3/ 

And I'd say "Yes" because I wanted to send the message.

Voice interfaces CANNOT DEAL WITH THAT. 2/

Previously on Google Now, whenever I sent voice texts, I'd dictate and then get the prompt "Do you want to send this?" 1/

In case you're curious, here's what a massive improvement in a voice UI looks (er, sounds) like: We also commiserated on the rise of authoritarian regimes and I confirmed that the HBO show Silicon Valley is so realistic it hurts.

It's that nobody knows when you made that thing or what v67 is. v67 is meaningless. The first team I joined at Google used v1, v2, v3 to name folders and you know what?

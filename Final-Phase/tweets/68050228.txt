Much more accurate. seriously tempted to change my twitter icon... http://t.co/FNngoZhYpf @bekathwia I should have said 'programming' instead of 'software', I think -- it's warranted for some software, esp. video editing! @cbonsig yes, that's what caused my initial comment. soldermask is thinnest at trace edges and holes, so vias are problematic. RT @planetepics: Mt Fuji from the International Space Station http://t.co/Iu2quo9uWG chasing down some weird timing errors w/the best clock domain music: https://t.co/s398gT672l @cbonsig also, it's a good idea to add a 'restrict' area directly under the battery so that nothing will be routed there. (2/2) @cbonsig you should be fine if the batt is rarely changed, just be sure to inspect the soldermask before you attached the batt clip (1/2) @cbonsig congrats! i might suggest you use care inserting/removing the coin cell, though. soldermask can wear off and cause shorts. @BrianSchmalz I think it's also because video is a (relatively) easy metric to track, and marketing departments love it. re: previous -- I understand vid. how-tos for some things. I wanted to add a lib. path to an IDE -- how is video the best choice for that? @Grathio I understand how-to vids for some things, like game easter eggs, but not for (in my case) adding a library path to an IDE. Am I the only one who hates software video how-to's? Write that shit down. startups: stop trying to replace email; email will bury you. @CollinMel I just happened to be doing some firmware flashing when it popped up in my feed -- serendipitous homonyms! @CollinMel SCK it to me. @Chris_Gammell (sorry, couldn't resist) :) @Chris_Gammell i read that bees don't like smoke, so maybe take a walk down by the lake? @Chris_Gammell bees are rare?

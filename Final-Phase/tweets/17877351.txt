We will work on getting those illustrations updated @jonkeegan just remember, rows don't connect over the middle gap. So if you plug power into a1, power would be available in a1-e1. @jonkeegan for example, in that circuit if you plugged power into row 1 and ground into row 2, those would be your +/- rows you could tap in @jonkeegan ok, I got you. You don't "have" to use the columns. Just put your ground and power into two different rows and wire in from there @jonkeegan if it doesn't have +/- columns, you can just designate a row for ground and a row for power and work around it that way. @jonkeegan do you have a picture of the breadboard? Just want to make sure I give you the right info @jonkeegan those are just marks to help you keep ground and power straight if you want to wire them in that way.

This is for something different @dennybritz I think it is a problem not many people have, though I do think it's real @lucidrains email me at jack@jack-clark.net @piccibiker @edersantana @michael_nielsen I don't think this is a thing you can automate @edersantana summaries leave out a lot of the data that would let you model general development of AI field. eg shared datasets, components @michael_nielsen there's tons of awesome data buried in all these papers as well, eg, 'tested on 1200 CPUs' is interesting, etc @michael_nielsen eg - tell me what datasets it uses, what components (resnets, lstms, GRUs, etc). Is there a new dataset contribution? SOTA? @michael_nielsen yes. I'm looking for extra data etc @natfriedman each paper takes about 30 mins to effectively skim (for me). So we're already at a 50+ hour week @natfriedman whooooo boyyyyy! AI papers get published across about 10 categories, so volume more like 100+ @kleinsound If we have ideas here, please let me know. I've struggled with this. @dhruvp probably interested as well @aneel Because they've been taught that science is a hard thing done by wizards on segways @johnloeber cool! email me! The challenge is I think UI and making sure people have incentive to do it @kleinsound give me money to make that happen @aneel like, people like @davegershgorn are a (treasured) minority who engage with actual research. Some people say they 'can't' read papers @aneel I mean, these are basically absurd suggestions. I have met very few people in these fields that read AI papers at all @aneel hahahahahaahahah @natfriedman I'm assuming the summary would include some analysis (eg, this builds on work done by so-and-so on NTMs, etc) @botminds @Miles_Brundage AI research. @nonsensews @mattsiegel Yup, my complaint is Miles doesn't spend all of his time summarizing papers to make my life easier. Bastard. @robinsloan also, yes, this is a problem - if you can roughly grok the papers you're probably already hella busy (eg @Miles_Brundage / me) @robinsloan I try and do some of it in ImportAI. Maybe I should ask people if they'd pay for research specific summaries? @niraj Yeah, I did some experiments on that last week: https://t.co/RlRFRO2HPO &lt; think could be viable, but needs more work @aneel AI interns tend to build AI @niraj I feel like getting MTurk people to summarize AI papers would go extremely wrong amazingly quickly @mattsiegel Miles just tweets papers.

I'll take both those out for and use Dave's suggestions for next time. @davekale @zacharylipton that's a good idea! @zacharylipton Roger that on review. I think novelty scores might be interesting to keep @zacharylipton I should probably not use the term review. Mostly wanted to see if there's a way to add more info beyond abstracts etc @olivercameron great! @ethancaballero I'd like to see how day 1 goes, then if it goes well will post tomorrow (due to ICML I expect sig arxiv volume all week) @volkuleshov cool! yes, link me when ready.

What are other areas where you think progress is slow? @OliverShackles plus, some people think true AI may require a quantum substrate @OliverShackles also, materials - we need to create better materials, eg superconductors, a replacement for silicon, etc. QComp will help @OliverShackles if you can more efficiently work out which things to focus on you accelerate science @OliverShackles a lot of science relies on being able to search a vast space for the small cone containing sensible candidates to focus on @OliverShackles loads of advanced stuff in chemistry becomes easier to simulate/compute @OliverShackles traveling salesman problems, decryption, physics simulations @nerdherdempire ah yes, thx. @nerdherdempire what does DRL acronym stand for?

Eg tools like Euclid from @etzioni @warnerw and there's just less money floating around among (most) workers in general. I'm very skeptical it's all sunshine and daisies. @warnerw so I think we'll see good jobs replaced with less good jobs, and many of the new jobs will be casual/contractor/task-based @warnerw that's because tech usually makes a market more efficient, so you get a wealthy administrative class, and then contractors @warnerw tech seems to create employment markets with a few highly-paid winners, few middle-class, and loads of working poor @warnerw and of the new jobs that are created, I am concerned that a large amount of them will give the human very little agency @warnerw oh, sure. Loads of entirely new economies to be built. However, I'm convinced that this time is different re labor substitution. @warnerw or if you prefer jack@openai.com and happy to chat in a lengthier format! @warnerw I'm struggling to understand you. I worry we're talking across eachother. Can you unwrap this a bit for me? @warnerw but I think the ability of capital to substitute for labor is starting to grow rapidly and this means loads of inequality/job loss @warnerw I'm not following you - I see labor elimination as a byproduct of efficiencies that come from tech progress. Not a goal etc @warnerw what do you mean? cotton production automation sucked for workers big time @_jyan_ doing what we can.as is @Miles_Brundage @JosepabloAr how did computers influence price of childcare? it's been getting consistently more expensive. same w/health &amp; elder @JosepabloAr why would healthcare or childcare or elder care get cheaper? (in US, specifically) @anshublog It's not a binary issue. But a sense of growing inequality leads to unpredictable/damaging effects in society (eg brexit/trump) @cloud_opinion computers enabled more inequality. networked markets become winner-take-all markets. eg google and web search. @KShoieb @gideonmann I hadn't read this. Thanks for passing on @phillytechnews former, though I have a hunch there are interesting tax implications, @Miles_Brundage ooh, when? email me draft? would love to collaborate! @anshublog and I guess I mean AI as in the limited sort being rolled out over next ~decade @anshublog I'm not sure I buy unlimited resources.

RT @jmelaskyriazi: @jackclarkSF one of the most difficult challenges we face as a society in the 21st century. @gideonmann I understand one and three, what do you mean by reservation wage? @rasmusoxenvad see big loada tweets to @gideonmann @gideonmann yeah, but it's a broad class. Eg, John Deere has a self-driving tractor, so that depreciates less as it gets new software @gideonmann plus, capital is way more predictable, so there's already a huge incentive to do this @gideonmann so from POV as a capital operator, the smarter I make it the more I save and the more it can substitute for labor @gideonmann capital is mostly a big dumb sunk cost. AI + IoT + post-installation augmentation can broaden scope, extend usefulness @gideonmann Google's data center equipment loses less value as RL lets you eke more out of it in terms of PUE metric. Googke doing this. @gideonmann similarly, greater swarm efficiencies from software in, say, Amazon's Kiva robots will offset other depreciation costs @gideonmann (and Fanuc is already doing it) @gideonmann eg industrial robots lose less value if you can more easily modify them to perform other tasks. RL will allow this. AI will reduce rate at which capital depreciates, further tipping scales in its favor against labor. How does society manage this shift?

Maybe this could provide the incentive we need to actually do parallel programming properly, though? @kentindell so if we can just add more cores in roughly the same network then we can see some benefits, so not so coupled to minituarization @kentindell idk. Seems like current AI systems can benefit from re-engineered compute substrates for speed-up. @qhardy I thought, as with most American things, the heart was some kind of melted cheese and/or sugary cream? So what I'm really keen to identify now are the 'brick walls' in AI research roadmaps. What problems currently seem insurmountable? Why? Once you have a concept a lot of tasks that computers find hard become easier. Factory pick&amp;place. Medical diag. Robotic movement policies. The next stage of AI is perceptual systems that can learn decent representations of what they're seeing. Our computers will learn 'concepts' In last couple of years it's become possible for computers to (cheaply) see the world &amp; applications have multipled.

(Though to be clear I think core is mostly iron) @atroyn My view is that it's not like a flat earth proposition, more like a 'we propose there's something more than iron in the core' @atroyn yes, which is a little problematic. Better for them to exist and spark debate than not exist at all, though. @atroyn yes, I agree with you on that point. I think there's value in checking in with them every now and then.

Waddup @rodolfor @Amirmizroch good points, thanks. @rodolfor @Amirmizroch ARM? @sarahjeong same! @mattmcknight Hmm. I'm not sure I'm fully understanding your point. Could you perhaps email me and I'll reply? Bit more coherent that way! @mattmcknight I think better to assume a certain level of bias in any data you grab from public sources and then clean proactively? @mattmcknight sure, but my question is how do you solve this on an internet-wide basis? You can't control all writers... @mattmcknight I can try to be responsible in my articles, but can the entire text corpus of the internet? Seems tricky! @mattmcknight so, better for entire internet to change the way it writes, than for ML experts to clean data after sampling? @ChrisSpencerFL Hi there, Jack Clark with Bloomberg News here, trying to get in touch with you.

Maybe a current of former @Twitter employee could offer a more informed opinion. :-) @xamat Would Twitter prefer I spread attention thinner like peanut butter? I doubt it; if anything, Twitter seems to embrace its asymmetry. @xamat I follow precisely the number of people I can read and engage with. I could spread that attention thinner but it's a finite-sum game. @xamat If I follow people but don't read and engage with what they write, then I'm just feeding a vanity metric. @xamat How would Twitter gain by my following more people, if that didn't increase my engagement (which it wouldn't)? RT @greglinden: Very big deal, a drop in battery prices changing how we generate power.

But pissing off your best customers invites the gale of creative destruction. #schumpeter @ManuKumar Bear in mind, I'm on LinkedIn several times a day. So I'm not exactly a representative user, even among premium members. @ManuKumar I have a test account that isn't premium that I occasionally use. I find the diff pretty stark. @ManuKumar Biggest benefit, in my view, is that it's easy to InMail people you don't know. Also you don't exhaust search / profile views. @nikhilbd Possibly. But they could try to make do without premium accounts. They're paying for premium, which raises their expectations. @drichards Premium account does offer value, especially to outbound professionals. But subscription fee should be sufficient to pay for it. @chirag_mehta As far as I can tell, same ads and sponsored content as for non-premium. I block them on desktop, but can't in the mobile app. I don't mean to sound ungrateful as the holder of a complimentary premium account. But ads are an un-premium experience. I've never understood why LinkedIn subjects premium members, who pay $60 per month, to ads and sponsored content. Premium should be ad-free. @DataJunkie So yes, he's a sadist.

Not sure earning is right metaphor @joshuaforman @BinaryIdiot Agree that a vast majority of people share expertise locally. But much of that is duplicative and quality varies. @m23mclaughlin @BinaryIdiot But people who trigger a groundswell of criticism by sharing what they feel are "insights" sometimes deserve it. @m23mclaughlin @BinaryIdiot I agree that it's a waste of time to respond to every critic.

I share insights pretty freely, and I believe that's made me more powerful, not less. @BinaryIdiot As for her point that the powerful hoard valuable insights, I might find it more compelling with concrete examples. Too meta? @BinaryIdiot I'm sympathetic to people who want to share their insights but can't afford the potential cost. Less so to those can afford it. @BinaryIdiot She says not sharing insights makes the powerful more powerful. But the converse is that the powerful define the conversation. @BinaryIdiot Her most salient point is "I don't have time to fight with people who are trying to misunderstand me." Trying implies bad faith Proud to have made @Quora Top Writer for a second year.

My bad. @xamat @sama I think we both know that's not how most tech company hiring processes work. Glad @Quora's an outlier based on your description @xamat @sama By experience I mean documented accomplishments plus easily demonstrated / evaluated tech skills. Resume + standard interview. @xamat Ignoring @sama's sloppy metaphor, do you agree that most hiring processes overvalue experience and undervalue potential? @xamat @sama I did say clumsy, and I was being generous. But yes, even in a linear model you need 2 parameters to specify the function. @xamat Generous interpretation would be that @sama is clumsily advocating hiring for potential and assuming you can evaluate that potential. @cdixon @xamat I've seen this claim in a couple of places.

But that's also true for Medium and Facebook. @MarcBodnick I see Twitter as unmatched for viral distribution of one-liners, or as a teaser to lure people to substantive content elsewhere @MarcBodnick Another example of a thoughtful, engaged conversaton in a public FB thread: https://t.co/Dp85uE3Jn1 @MarcBodnick Here's an example from yesterday: compare https://t.co/kgKMLvVT1b to https://t.co/2GafUGZZ8A @MarcBodnick I'd say the main non-transient aspect of Twitter is negative: your embarrassing tweets live forever. But good content fades. @MarcBodnick Also I find that content on Twitter is mostly transient compared to platforms designed for content to have longevity. @MarcBodnick To clarify, I'm referring to my personal experience posting on both platforms. But happy to show you examples. @MarcBodnick And personally I find that public Facebook posts result in higher-quality comment threads than Twitter. @MarcBodnick Fair enough. But you get a lot of that from a single tweet that links to a long-form post elsewhere. @MarcBodnick I don't understand why people resort to tweetstorms when there are platforms that don't impose artificial 140-character limits.

RT @Techmeme: Facebook's claim that it isn't a media entity is becoming increasingly untenable (@mathewi) https://t.co/oMubE9dFII https://t… I agree with @mathewi that Facebook is a media company. Am surprised they deny it. https://t.co/v0s795rnw3 @KimThatWas And I get that nudity != porn. But that's a hard classification problem for humans, let alone algorithms. And the law is harsh. @KimThatWas And does common carrier status immunize FB from US child pornography laws? If not, makes sense that they err on side of caution. @KimThatWas Or how about when Amazon, Walmart, and others decided not to sell Confederate flag merchandise? https://t.co/iAIm1EF7c0 @KimThatWas I see social media platforms as having authority&amp;responsibility to set editorial standards. Which rest of us are free to debate. @KimThatWas It isn't so clear cut to me. For example, I wish Twitter would do more to stop harassment and abuse. Some call that censorship. @MarcBodnick So much for browser neutrality. :-) @KimThatWas IANAL but I imagine  the US government gives common carriers a lot of discretion to prohibit nudity -- especially child nudity. Irony compounds: Aftenposten letter protesting Facebook's censorship trending on FB. Including photo of Napalm Girl. https://t.co/2KT3sHGvKT @movito Likewise! @movito @juliacarriew @anineki Deleting discussions of censorship strikes me as far more arbitrary and defensive than disallowing nudity. @KimThatWas What struck me as ironic was an editor saying that FB didn't have the right to not distribute his story on editorial grounds. @KimThatWas That's fair. I suppose this is simply a public lobbying effort to get FB to change its editorial policy. @movito @juliacarriew That part I was unaware of. And that does strike me as much uglier. @movito @juliacarriew In this case the rule doesn't seem so black-boxed. FB has been pretty clear about its uneasiness with nudity. @movito @juliacarriew And I'm glad that he did. That doesn't mean FB has to publish or distribute it, any more than any other media outlet. @movito @juliacarriew Not saying I agree with FB's editorial decision or policy. Just that I believe it's theirs to define and enforce. @movito @juliacarriew You don't find it at all ironic that an editor is making editorial demands of FB to get a story distributed there?

And it's hard to do that just through process. @marcprecipice I don't have silver bullets. Ultimately it's easier to hire inclusively when company is already inclusive. Cold start problem @marcprecipice Screening is harder since it can be just one person deciding. But you can shadow until everyone is calibrated. @marcprecipice And analyze process to keep yourself honest. See where your funnel breaks down and figure out why -- or who -- is the reason. @marcprecipice And of course have diverse interview panels, working through differences to surface biases. @marcprecipice Sourcing is easy place to improve. Be a place where underrepresented folks want to be and show it. Eg https://t.co/oYRHwYXN1j @marcprecipice Agree that we need to remove systematic bias at each stage of hiring funnel. Not convinced that defaulting to yes helps. @marcprecipice But these are quibbles. I agree with her way more than I disagree. @marcprecipice And my onsite-to-offer ratio target is 50%. Helps interviewers buy in to process and have the energy to help close candidates @marcprecipice Disagree on defaulting to yes. It's an optimization problem and you should have a target at each stage, informed by data. @marcprecipice I'm less excited about challenges / puzzles as entry points, even if they're optional. Though maybe FB data argues otherwise.

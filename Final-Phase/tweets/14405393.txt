I'll read the article later about 4H and the Maker movement.  Let's not forget rural comms. #bnmakerchat I don't try to explain makerspaces or Maker Faire.  I just get people to come visit and experience them. @FabTechEC @tanjuB  #bnmakerchat Can you say more?  @jenhkling  I think celebrating makers helps others recognize that it something they can do too. #bnmakerchat That's what I like about Maker Faire -- I'm surprised by what others have imagined and created.  @roryoconnor @ThinkFun  #bnmakerchat Maker Camp is a great way to get your Girl Scout troop making things.   See https://t.co/mu1xeroVVB.  @lorene4too  @BNBuzz #bnmakerchat It is about process more than results.  Process like practice is something you own and can apply over and over again. @IfSpace  #bnmakerchat Yes, Carol.  It is about play and develop a love of learning and becoming a good learner. @CarolTang1 @creativitykids #bnmakerchat Project favs?  I liked one that was creating spin art on old LP records.  Another was spirographs with scooters. @jamiestinson  #bnmakerchat Also, we have 4H clubs involved in Maker Camp as well.   Love to see us work together. @4Hpro @4H  @make #bnmakerchat We are sending some of our team to the 4H National Youth Summit on Makers next week. @4Hpro @4H  @make #bnmakerchat I love 4H.  I worked for 4H and my kids were in it.  @RonBoire @4Hpro @4H  @make #bnmakerchat We are seeing some schools integrate making across the school and integrating every subject. @tabledotco  @make #bnmakerchat Also, I started the Maker Ed Initiative to focus on spreading making to those who won't get it #makered @makeredorg @ABoklage #bnmakerchat I agree.  We need to include everybody and we need help from everybody to do that.   We need mentors, resources, etc. @ABoklage #bnmakerchat I think we forgot that "learning by doing" is essential -- and it's what makes science and tech so interesting. @pburgstem  #bnmakerchat Great Q.  We lost something in closing down shop class.  Making is shop class + cs lab + art studio + bio lab @pburgstem  #bnmakerchat We can do connect them through collaboration, learning from each other the practices of making with children @extraordinaires  #bnmakerchat I don't like acronyms but I love science, technology, engineering, art, math &amp; more @BNBuzz @SpinMaster @littleBits  @RonBoire  #bnmakerchat I don't like acronyms but I love science, technology, engineering, art, math &amp; more @BNBuzz @SpinMaster @littleBits  @RonBoire  #bnmakerchat Making integrates lots of fields or disciplines.   That's the beauty of it.  @traveller_123 @BNBuzz @littleBits  @RonBoire #bnmakerchat Completely agree.   There is this sense of participation in creating the culture that we are a part of.  @AnthroPunk #bnmakerchat @roryoconnor How do you see it different?   Woz and gang were makers, but didn't have the term. #bnmakerchat Good Q.  In many ways it is the same.  I do see self-expression as a driver of making today, which is different. @roryoconnor  #bnmakerchat Then we see that it helps to build a local and global maker community. @CrankyLinuxUser @make #bnmakerchat We want to celebrate and recognize what people do and make.  @CrankyLinuxUser @make #bnmakerchat The MM inspires people to see themselves as producers, not just consumers @onecoolcanuck @BNBuzz @SpinMaster @OfficialMeccano #bnmakerchat I want us to focus on all the possible ways to engage kids as makers -- at home, in school, etc @BNBuzz @littleBits  @ronboire #bnmakerchat Hi there! @traveller_123 @BNBuzz @RonBoire #bnmakerchat . @RonBoire However, when I started Make Magazine in 2005, it gave a name to people who created, built, shaped, crafted
